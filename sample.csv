Structure (or Chemical Component) Characterizations: Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected from Agilent Technologies Gemini AUltra system with Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at RT.The structures were resolved and refined using direct methods with OLEX2.Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and d were performed on an X-ray powder diffractometer (D2 Phaser, Bruker, Germany) at RT.A typical scan rate was 10 s step -1 with a step size of 0.02°.Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) was carried out using a TA instrument (Q50 TGA system).The samples were heated from RT (~ 25 °C) to 800 °C with at a rate of 10 °C min -1 under an argon flux of 20 mL min -1 .XPS measurements of the samples were conducted on a Thermal K-Alpha spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source.Parameters of the π-π interactions and hydrogen-bond geometry in A2ZnCl4•H2O, A2ZnBr4•H2O, A2SnCl6, A2H3OInCl6•H2O, ACl and ABr got from OLEX2.

Optical Characterizations: UV-visible absorption spectra of the materials were obtained from the Agilent Cary5000 spectrophotometer equipped with integrating sphere to exclude signal due to light scattering.BaSO4 was used as a non-absorbing reflectance reference for diffuse-reflectance measurements.The photoluminescence quantum yields were measured on a calibrated integrating sphere.Steady-state RT and temperature-dependent excitation and emission spectra were recorded on a photoluminescence spectrometer (Horiba Fluorolog-3, Horiba Ltd.), and their corresponding transient photoluminescence spectra were also recorded on Fluorolog-3 with the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) mode.The photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) were measured on Fluorolog-3 with a calibrated integrating sphere.Time-resolved emission spectroscopy (TRES) characterization were performed on FLS 1000.In detail, a pulsed light source excites a sample, and the resulting photoluminescence attenuation is continuously recorded as a function of the emission wavelength to create a three-dimensional data that includes photoluminescence spectra and time correlation.The FluOracle software of FLS 1000 can automatically obtain TRES spectra using TCSPC or MCS modes to measure short and long lifetimes, respectively.VPLED310 is set to a pulse width of 800 ms and 10 Hz repetition rate.Use MCS mode to obtain photoluminescence attenuation in the wavelength range of 400-700 nm with a step size of 5 nm.Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was measured by the Perkin Elmer (United States), using a DTGS detector.The parameter settings: scanning range: 4000~400 cm -1 , resolution: 4 cm -1 , cumulative scanning of 4 ATR tests.Spectral analysis using the instrument's built-in Spectrum software.

Femtosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy Measurements: The fs-TA measurements were performed on a Helios pump-probe system (Ultrafast Systems LLC) combined with an amplified femtosecond laser system (Coherent).Optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-800-fs) provided a 330 nm pump pulse (~ 0.5μJ/pulse, which was excited by a Ti: sapphire regenerative amplifier (Legend Elite-1K-HE; 800 nm), 35 fs, 7 mJ/pulse, 1 kHz) and seeded with a mode-locked Ti: sapphire laser system (Micra 5) and an Nd: YLF laser (EvolutIon 30) pumped.Focusing the 800 nm beams (split from the regenerative amplifier with a tiny portion, ~ 400 nJ/pulse onto a CaF2 plate produced the white-light continuum (WLC) probe pulses (350-650nm).

The pulse-to-pulse fluctuation of the WLC is corrected by a reference beam split from WLC.A motorized optical delay line was used to change the time delays (0 ~ 8 ns) between the pump and probe pulses.The instrument response function (IRF) was determined to be ~ 100 fs by a routine cross-correlation procedure.The instrument response function (IRF) was determined to be ~100 fs by a routine cross-correlation procedure.A mechanical chopper operated at a frequency of 500 Hz used to modulate the pump pulses such that the fs-TA spectra with and without the pump pulses can be recorded alternately.

Hirshfeld Surfaces and Two-Dimensional Fingerprint Plots: The intermolecular interactions for all materials in this work were investigated through Hirshfeld surface analysis by using Crystal Explore 17.5.1 First, the CIF file was uploaded into the software.In the window of surface generation, the surface was set as ""Hirshfeld"", and the option ""None"" was chose for its property.After generating a Hirshfeld surface, ""Surface property"" was set as ""dnorm"".Further, in the window of two-dimensional fingerprint plots, the option ""di vs de"" was defaulted for the type.dnorm is the normalized contact distance, di is the distance from a point on the Hirshfeld surface to the nearest atom inside the surface, and de is the distance from a point on the Hirshfeld surface to the nearest atom outside the surface.

Computational Methods: All calculations were based on the density functional theory (DFT) implemented in the VASP code.The projector augmented wave (PAW) method was used with a cutoff energy of 400 eV.The electron exchange correlation effect was represented by the PerdewBurke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional under the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).The optimization of lattice parameters was based on the experimentally measured values, while the atomic positions were optimized until the force on each atom was <0.02 eV Å -1 .The total energy was converged to 10 -6 eV.The k-point separation was set as 0.04 Å -1 in the Brillouin zone leading to corresponding Γ-centered k-point meshes of A2ZnBr4•H2O: 3×1×1; A2SnCl6: 3× 2 × 2; ACl: 5×2×2; A2H3OInCl6•H2O: 3×3×1.

It is not clear whether oral contraceptive (OC) treatment affects premenstrual symptoms in women. The aim of the present study was to evaluate changes in premenstrual symptoms (PMS) in women starting to use or discontinuing the use of OCs. Twenty-four healthy women with no previous diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder were included in this study with a prospective crossover design. Nineteen women completed daily ratings of somatic and mood symptoms during two hormonally different cycles, during a normal menstrual cycle and while using OCs. The menstrual cycle phases were hormonally verified and the low-dose, monophasic OCs were used in a 21/7 regimen. The onset of OC use significantly decreased premenstrual somatic symptoms, but it did not affect mood symptoms. In the women who discontinued OC use, no significant changes in neither somatic nor mood symptoms appeared in the premenstrual phase.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction

Menstrual cycle-related symptoms are experienced by 70-80% women of fertile age [1]. Up to 50% reported mild to moderate premenstrual symptoms (PMS) and 2-8% of those are diagnosed with the more severe premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) [1,2]. The etiology of PMS/PMDD is still not fully known. However, symptoms are provoked by sex steroids produced by the corpus luteum and are diminished by suppressing ovarian activity [2]. Hence, OC treatment has been a common method to treat PMS [3], although randomized and placebo-controlled studies have shown inconclusive results [4][5][6]. In placebo-controlled trials, OCs containing drospirenone have demonstrated beneficial effects on somatic, as well as mood symptoms in women with PMS [7][8][9].

Observational studies have failed to detect differences in cyclic symptoms between non-OC users and OC users [1,10]. To the best of our knowledge, no research has been performed on changes in luteal phase-related mood and somatic symptoms in the same woman when switching from using to not using OCs, or vice versa.

The aim of the study was to prospectively evaluate PMS in healthy women when switching from not using to using lowdose monophasic OCs or after switching from the use of an OC to a normal menstrual cycle in a crossover design.


Methods


Study population

Twenty-four female students volunteered to participate. The subjects were healthy, nonsmokers and none of the subjects had been diagnosed earlier with PMDD. All women gave their written informed consent to participate. The study was approved by the local Ethical Committee (D.nr 01-311).


Study design

A crossover design was used in which the subjects were divided into Non-OC Starters and OC Starters, depending on whether they started the study using OCs or not ( Figure 1). The Non-OC Starters (n ¼ 12) had not been using OCs for at least 3 months prior to entering the study, whereas the OC Starters (n ¼ 12) had been using OCs for at least 3 months up to 9 years. The OCs used in the study were all low-dose, monophasic pills with the amount of ethinyl estradiol ranging between 25 and 30 mg, combined with different progestagens. The administrative scheduling of OCs was 21 days of active hormones and 7 days of withdrawal (pill-free phase). All subjects performed daily ratings of PMS during the entire study period using Cyclicity Diagnoser (CDs); see description below.

The Non-OC Starters entered the study on day 1 in the menstrual cycle and an ovulatory cycle was confirmed by detection of elevated progesterone after the surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) (Figure 1). After the ovulatory cycle, the Non-OC Starters were prescribed oral contraceptives for 1 month before assessment. During the second pill chart, which started on the first pill-free day, ratings of symptoms using the CD scales were performed.

The OC Starters entered the study on the first pill-free day of the OC treatment cycle (Figure 1). After the first pill chart was completed, the same women discontinued the OC treatment for a washout period and awaited ovulation. If ovulation did not occur after 3 months, the subject was excluded from the study. The remaining subjects detected ovulation and rated their PMS.


Cyclicity diagnosis

A prospective rating of PMS was performed daily during the two assessment cycles in the respective group. A previously validated cyclicity diagnosis of PMS, Cyclicity Diagnoser (CD) [11,12], was used. The CD scale consists of somatic symptoms (swelling and breast tenderness); negative mood parameters (depression, fatigue, irritability, tension, mood swings); positive mood parameters (cheerfulness, energy); symptoms measuring control (difficulty in concentrating, out of control); sleep problems; and less interest in daily activities. In addition, the CD scale contains parameters for measuring menstrual bleeding; and the comprehensive symptom general impairment aimed at measuring interference with family life, usual social activities, and work or school efficiency. The CD scale is a Likert scale ranging from 0 to 8.

Related symptoms were grouped together and the mean scores of the symptoms were summarized. The somatic symptoms were summarized with a maximum score of 16 and the negative mood symptoms were summarized with a maximum score of 40. The comprehensive symptom of general impairment was treated separately. To determine cyclicity in individual women, the symptoms were compared between the menstrual and the premenstrual phases. Subjects were considered cyclic if they showed a significant increase in at least one negative mood symptom and/or at least one somatic symptom in the premenstrual phase, compared to the menstrual phase.

To procure comparable cycles, the cycles were idealized to 28 days. Day 1 was set to the first day of menstrual flow (scores !3 on the CD scale) [13]. The follicular phase (menstrual phase) was defined as day 3 up to and including day 9 in the menstrual cycle. In the OC cycle, the menstrual phase was defined as day 3 to day 7 in the pill-free phase, and including day 1 and day 2 on the pill chart. The premenstrual phase was in the menstrual cycle defined as day 24 to day 28 of an ovulatory cycle and the first 2 days in the consecutive cycle [14]. The definition of the premenstrual phase in the OC cycle was set to day 17 to day 21 on the pill chart and the first two pill-free days in the consecutive cycle.


Blood sampling and hormone assays

Hormone levels were determined to verify ovulatory cycles as well as verification of compliance with OC treatment. After centrifugation, serum was separated and stored at À20 C until analyzed. Follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), LH, estradiol (E2), progesterone (P-4), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were analyzed in serum using chemiluminescent enzyme immunometric assays (IMMULITE Automated Analyzer, DPC). Ovulation was determined by Ovustrix V R (Clearplan, Unipath Limited, Bedford, England) by detecting the LH surge in urine.


Data analyses and statistical methods

All data are presented using descriptive statistics, means (SD/ SEM), and the number of observations. To diagnose cyclical changes in CD scale symptoms in individual women, the Mann-Whitney U-test was used to identify women with cyclicity [12]. To detect changes in the number of women with cyclicity between the normal menstrual cycle and the OC cycle, the Chisquare test was used. To analyze the difference between the menstrual and premenstrual phase, the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used. Group data were further analyzed by using repeated measures ANOVA, comparing the 7 days in the menstrual phase with the 7 days in the premenstrual phase during the menstrual cycle vs. the OC cycle. The Fisher post hoc test for multiple comparisons was used to assess differences between the menstrual cycle and the OC cycle. All tests were two-sided and the level of significance was set to .05.


Results


Drop-outs

Out of the 24 women included, five had to be excluded for various reasons (Figure 1).

Nineteen subjects completed the study. The mean (SD) for age and BMI in the Non-OC Starters (n ¼ 11) were 27.2 (4.5) years and 23.4 (4.5) kg/m 2 , respectively, and for the OC Starters (n ¼ 8) 26.4 (2.5) years and 23.7 (6.9) kg/m 2 . There were no significant differences between the groups.


Hormone levels

Hormone levels in the different phases of the menstrual cycle and on the corresponding days of the OC cycle are shown in Table 1 and it shows a normal variation.


The premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle and the OC cycle

In all women (n ¼ 19), the summarized somatic symptoms during the premenstrual phase were significantly higher during the normal menstrual cycle, compared to the corresponding days of the OC cycle (p < .05) (Figure 2A). However, the summarized negative mood symptoms did not differ between the two cycles ( Figure 2B). The score on the comprehensive symptom impairment tended to be higher during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle compared to the OC cycle (p ¼ .06).


Cyclicity in Non-OC starters and OC starters

Among the Non-OC Starters, 8 out of 11 women showed significant cyclical changes (p < .05) in the summarized somatic symptom scores during the normal menstrual cycle. After having switched to OC treatment, there was a tendency to fewer subjects (4/11) showing cyclicity in summarized somatic symptom scores (p ¼ .09). Figure 3 illustrates summarized somatic symptoms in one woman showing cyclicity during the normal menstrual cycle, but not during the following OC cycle. In contrast, for summarized negative mood scores, 4 out of 11 women were considered to be cyclic during the normal menstrual cycle, whereas in the OC cycle, there was no significant change in negative mood scores (2/11).

For the OC Starters, 2 out of 8 women showed cyclicity in summarized somatic symptoms during the OC cycle. After washout, there was no significant change in the summarized somatic symptoms (2/8) in the normal menstrual cycle. For summarized negative mood scores, the proportion of women showing cyclicity in the OC cycle was 2 out of 8. After the washout period, a proportion of 4/8 women showed cyclicity in summarized negative mood scores (ns).


Change in cyclicity in the groups of Non-OC starters and OC starters

The Non-OC Starters (n ¼ 11), showed a significantly higher increase in summarized somatic symptoms in the premenstrual phase of the normal menstrual cycle compared to the following OC cycle (p < .05). However, there was no significant difference in the cyclicity of summarized negative mood symptoms within the normal menstrual cycle than the OC cycle. For the OC Starters, the cyclicity in summarized somatic symptoms, as well as the cyclicity of summarized negative mood symptoms within the OC cycle, was comparable to that in the following normal menstrual cycle.


Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective study on cyclical symptoms in healthy women switching from not using OCs to OC treatment or vice versa. In all of the women, it was demonstrated that somatic symptoms were significantly greater during the premenstrual phase of the normal menstrual cycle compared to the corresponding days of the OC cycle. In the Non-OC Starters, the proportion of women showing cyclicity in somatic symptoms during the normal menstrual cycle was significantly greater compared to the following OC cycle. However, the proportion of women showing cyclical mood symptoms was not changed. In the group of OC Starters, the proportion of women showing cyclicity in somatic or mood symptoms did not change in the following normal menstrual cycle. The present study demonstrated that somatic symptoms were more frequently reported during the normal menstrual cycle, compared to during the OC treatment cycle. However, in a study of prospective ratings, about 75% experienced cyclicity in somatic symptoms, regardless of the use of OCs [1]. Negative mood symptoms are less common in women regardless of OC treatment. This was found in the present study and are in agreement with Sveinsd ottir and B€ ackstr€ om [1]. However, Zethraeus et al. [15] showed that women who used OCs reported significantly lower general well-being compared to women on placebo.

Only a few randomized controlled trials have been published evaluating the effect of OCs on PMS [5,16]. The treatment effect of combined OCs on PMS and PMDD seems to be dependent on the type of progestagen, the dosage of ethinyl estradiol, and the length of the withdrawal phase [2,[7][8][9][17][18][19]. In the present study, the OC Starters had proportionally fewer symptoms, compared to the Non-OC Starters. The reason for this group to have fewer symptoms might be due to good tolerance to the OC treatment as they had used OC under a longer period prior to the study. The eventual discontinuation of OC treatment due to side effects usually occurs during the initial months of OC use [20,21]. It can be speculated that this group did not gain any significant increase in cyclical symptoms scores when terminating OC use since the washout period of 1 month were too short, despite an ovulatory cycle.

The sample size in the present study was quite small. Twentyfour women were included initially. The dropout rate was, however, relatively high, which is common in this kind of menstrualcycle-related study. Some of the women entering the study on OCs had to be excluded because they failed to show ovulation within 3 months. It has been reported that it might take up to six cycles to normalize the menstrual cycle [22]. Additionally, the cycle length in these women was not known beforehand, resulting in difficulties in detecting the time of eventual ovulation.

Some other limitations of this study should also be addressed. The OC Starters had been on OCs for different periods of time and the women were using different types of progestagens, even though all were low-dose monophasic pills combined with ethinyl estradiol.

More studies with an extended number of subjects, grouped under different types of OC and a more comparable length of treatment, should be conducted for confirmation of our results. In conclusion, OCs seem to improve somatic premenstrual symptoms in healthy women of fertile age, but they did not seem to have an effect on mood symptoms in this study group. during the menstrual cycle and OC cycle, respectively. A significant increase in summarized somatic symptom scores was found during the menstrual cycle, as compared to the OC cycle; no significant changes between cycles were found in the negative mood symptoms. The 7 days in the premenstrual phase are set to 24-28, including days 1-2.

Background: Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is a frequent malignancy of the digestive system with a poor prognosis and high mortality rate worldwide. Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) is associated with tumor progression, poor prognosis, immunosuppression, and therapy resistance. However, the relationship between ITH and prognosis, the immune microenvironment, and the chemotherapy response in COAD patients remains unknown, and this knowledge is urgently needed.Results: The OS of the high-ITH group was worse than that of the low-ITH group. A positive correlation between ITH and TMB was identified. In subgroups stratified by age, gender, and tumor stage, the OS of the low-ITH group remained better than that of the high-ITH group. There were dramatic differences in the mutated genes, single nucleotide variant classes, variant types, immune checkpoints and cooccurring and mutually exclusive mutations of the DEGs between the high-and low-ITH groups. Based on the DEGs between the high-and low-ITH groups, we constructed a five-gene signature consisting of CEACAM5, ENO2, GABBR1, MC1R, and SLC44A4. The COAD patients were divided into high-and low-risk groups according to the median risk score. The OS of the high-risk group was worse than that of the low-risk group. The nomogram was used to accurately predict the 1-, 3-and 5-year OS of COAD patients and showed good calibration and moderate discrimination ability. The stromal score, immune score, and ESTIMATE score of the high-risk group were significantly higher than those of the low-risk group, whereas tumor purity showed the opposite trend. The patients classified by the risk score had distinguishable sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. Finally, two public databases confirmed that CEACAM5 and SLC44A4 were upregulated in normal tissues compared with COAD tissues, and ENO2, GABBR1, and MC1R were upregulated in COAD tissues compared with normal tissues.Conclusion: Overall, we identified an ITH-related prognostic signature for COAD that was closely related to the tumor microenvironment and chemotherapy response. This signature may help clinicians make more personalized and precise treatment decisions for COAD patients.

Methods: We obtained clinical information and gene expression data for COAD patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The DEPTH2 algorithm was utilized to evaluate the ITH score. X-tile software was used to determine the optimal cutoff value of the ITH score. The COAD patients were divided into high-and low-ITH groups based on the cutoff value. We analyzed prognosis, tumor mutation burden (TMB), gene mutations, and immune checkpoint expression between the high-and low-ITH groups. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the high-and low-ITH groups were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. We performed univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analyses to screen the prognosis-related genes for the construction of an ITH-related prognostic signature. The nomogram was used to predict the overall survival (OS) of COAD patients. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by using the GeneMANIA database. Principal component analysis (PCA) and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) were employed to explore the differences in biological pathway activation status between the high-and low-risk groups. The proportion and type of tumor-infiltrating immune cells were evaluated by the CIBERSORT and ESTIMATE algorithms. Additionally, we assessed the chemotherapy response and predicted small-molecule drugs for treatment. Finally, the expression of the prognosis-related genes was validated by using the UALCAN database and Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database.


INTRODUCTION

Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), a highly heterogeneous malignancy, is the third most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide (1,2). Most COAD cases are diagnosed in an advanced stage due to its insidious onset, delayed diagnosis, and proclivity for metastasis, which contribute to a poor prognosis. Despite advances in current standard treatment strategies, such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, the 5-year OS of COAD patients remains dismal (3). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a novel biomarker to improve outcomes in patients with COAD, allowing early intervention and reducing the increasing burden of COAD.

One of the characteristics of COAD is intratumoral and individual-level heterogeneity heterogeneity (4). Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) refers to differences in molecular and phenotypic profiles between different tumor cells within a tumor (5). The available evidence suggests that ITH is strongly associated with tumor progression, aggressiveness, treatment resistance, and disease recurrence in various cancer types (6,7). ITH may increase tumor resistance to therapy and act as an independent prognostic factor for COAD (8). With the rise of next-generation sequencing technology and machine learning, researchers have developed various methods (MATH, PhyloWGS, ABSOLUTE and tITH) for quantifying ITH (9)(10)(11)(12). Song et al. showed that DEPTH2 is a novel algorithm for evaluating ITH based on mRNA levels, and compared with other algorithms, DEPTH2 has wider application and stronger competitiveness in characterizing ITH (13).

In the present study, we quantified the ITH of COAD in patients from the TCGA database by using the DEPTH2 algorithm. We analyzed prognosis, tumor mutational burden (TMB), mutated genes, and immune checkpoint expression in the high-and low-ITH groups. Next, we constructed an ITH-related signature and separated COAD patients into highand low-risk groups based on the median risk score. In addition, we explored the association of the signature with the prognosis, immune microenvironment, and chemotherapy response and further validated the predictive value of the signature. Collectively, our findings indicate that the ITH-related signature is a robust and reliable biomarker that may provide new insights into the prognosis and treatment of COAD.


MATERIALS AND METHODS


Data Collection and Processing

RNA sequencing transcriptome data, somatic mutation data, and the corresponding clinical information of COAD patients were downloaded from the TCGA database (https://portal.gdc.cancer. gov/). The detailed clinical information for the COAD patients is presented in Supplementary Table S1. Patients were excluded if they had incomplete survival information; in all, 452 COAD patients were assessed.

Calculation of the ITH Score and Definition of the Optimal Cutoff Value DEPTH2 is a new algorithm for assessing ITH at the mRNA level; it has broad applications and is highly competitive with other algorithms for ITH measurement. Here, we calculated the ITH score using the DEPTH2 algorithm (13). The principle of Xtile software (version 3.6.1, Yale University, USA) was to group different ITH scores to determine cutoff values for statistical analysis, and the result with p < 0.05 was the optimal cutoff value for separating patients into high-and low-ITH groups (14).


Gene Mutation Analysis

Somatic mutations of the top twenty mutated genes between the high-and low-risk groups were presented using the ""maftools"" package. Then, we calculated the TMB for each patient in the high-and low-risk groups. Additionally, the correlation between the TMB and ITH score was evaluated via Spearman correlation analysis.


Identification of Differentially Expressed ITH-Related Genes

The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the high-and low-ITH groups were analyzed using the ""limma"" package, with the filter criteria of |log2Fold change (FC) | > 0.5 and p-value < 0.05. The DEGs were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses with the ""clusterProfiler"" package.


Construction and Validation of the ITH-Related Prognostic Signature

The DEGs were subjected to univariate Cox regression analysis to acquire genes related to OS. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis was conducted using the ""glmnet"" package. Then, we performed multivariate Cox regression analysis and identified five genes. The ITH-related prognostic signature score was calculated based on the following formula: Risk score = (−0.15233956)
× CEACAM5 + (0.113295033) × ENO2 + (0.159639519) × GABBR1 + (0.5952466) × MC1R + (0.039993577) × SLC44A4.
The patients were classified into high-or low-risk groups according to the median risk score. We conducted Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis and compared the overall survival (OS) between the two subgroups to assess the prognostic value of the signature. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated using the ""timeROC"" package. To analyze the impact of the ITH-related prognostic signature on COAD progression, we clarified the relationship between the risk score and clinical parameters (gender, age, and stage) with the chi-square test.


Nomogram Establishment and Assessment

The predictive nomogram combining the risk score and clinical features was constructed by using the ""rms"" and ""regplot"" packages. We evaluated the prognosis of COAD patients at 1, 3, and 5 years in the nomogram. Calibration curves, ROC curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were applied to verify the reliability and accuracy of the nomogram.


Functional Enrichment Analysis

The correlation of the five key prognostic genes was conducted by Spearman correlation analysis. GeneMANIA (http://www. genemania.org) is an interactive, user-friendly, and intuitive website that constructs a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network (15,16). In the present study, a PPI network for five key prognostic genes was constructed by using the GeneMANIA website. Principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to assess the classification accuracy of the signature. Hallmark gene sets between the high-and low-risk groups were analyzed by using the ssGSEA algorithm. The mRNA expression levels of crucial prognostic genes were acquired from the UALCAN database (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/). The protein expression levels of crucial prognostic genes were obtained based on immunohistochemical (IHC) staining images downloaded from the Human Protein Atlas database (HPA; https://www. proteinatlas.org/).


Evaluation of Immune Cell Infiltration

The infiltration levels of 22 tumor-infiltrating immune cells were evaluated by using the CIBERSORT algorithm. We implemented the ESTIMATE algorithm to calculate the stromal score, immune score, ESTIMATE score and tumor purity. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was performed to quantify the immune enrichment score of each sample. The anticancer immune response, also known as the cancer-immunity cycle, is characterized by seven steps that occur in the tumor microenvironment. Tracking Tumor Immunophenotype (TIP; http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/TIP/) is a platform for evaluating and visualizing antitumor immune activity and the proportion of tumor-infiltrating immune cells during each of the seven steps (17). Here, we analyzed the anticancer immune status and extent of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in the high-and low-risk groups as well as differences in the activity scores across the seven steps.


Chemotherapeutic Sensitivity and Small-Molecule Drugs

The chemotherapeutic drug response of the COAD patients was evaluated by using the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GSDC) database (https://www.cancerrxgene.org/) (18). We calculated the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) using the ""pRRophetic"" package and assessed the patient response to common chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, we uploaded DEGs to the Connectivity Map (cMap; https://portals. broadinstitute.org/cmap/) database and predicted drugs based on the prognostic signature. Enrichment scores ranged from −1 to 0, and p < 0.05 was considered to indicate a potential candidate compound. The 3D structures of these compounds were obtained from the PubChem database (https://pubchem. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).


Statistical Analysis

R software (Version 4.0.5, https://www.r-project.org/) was used for all statistical analyses and plotting. Correlation was performed using Spearman's correlation. A Cox regression model was performed for univariate and multivariate analyses. Differences in clinical characteristics between the different groups were analyzed with the chi-square test. p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.


RESULTS


ITH Estimation and Stratification Analysis in COAD Patients

The flow diagram of this study is shown in Supplementary Figure S1. First, we calculated the ITH score of 452 COAD patients from the TCGA database using the DEPTH2 algorithm. Then, we used X-tile software to determine that the optimal cutoff value for the ITH score was 0.78 ( Figure 1A). The COAD patients were segregated into highand low-ITH groups based on the cutoff value. The high-ITH group had poorer OS than the low-ITH group ( Figure 1B). Furthermore, in subgroups stratified by age, gender, and tumor stage, the low-ITH group had better OS than the high-ITH group (Figures 1C-H).


Mutations and Immunotherapeutic Responses of the two Subgroups

Considering that the TMB is associated with the efficacy of immunotherapy, we calculated the TMB for each COAD patient. As expected, the high-TMB group tended to have a higher TMB than the low-TMB group (Figure 2A). Furthermore, we evaluated the latent relevance of ITH and TMB in COAD patients. As shown in Figure 2B, there was a positive correlation between ITH and TMB via Spearman correlation analysis (r = 0.12, p = 0.017, Figure 2B). Figures 2C,D summarize the mutation information for the high-and low-ITH groups, respectively. Subsequently, the mutations associated with the different ITH subgroups were visualized by waterfall plots. APC (58%), TTN (56%), TP53 (49%), MUC16 (38%) and KMT2D (31%) were the top five genes with the highest mutation frequencies in the high-ITH group, while APC (77%), TP53 (55%), TTN (52%), KRAS (43%) and PIK3CA (31%) were the top five genes in the low-ITH group (Figures 2E,F). In addition, we observed the co-occurrence of mutations, such as TTN and KMT2D mutations, in the high-ITH group ( Figure 2G) and mutually exclusive mutations, such as APC and DNAH11 mutations, in the low-ITH group ( Figure 2H). Given the importance of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the clinical treatment of COAD, we further analyzed the differential expression of immune checkpoint genes and found significant differences in the levels of CD44, CD70, CTLA4, HAVCR2, and HHLA2 between the high-and low-ITH groups ( Figure 2I).


Identification of Differentially Expressed ITH-Related Genes

Through differential gene expression analysis between the highand low-ITH groups, we obtained 421 differentially expressed ITH-related genes, namely, 173 upregulated genes and 248 downregulated genes. These DEGs were visualized using a volcano plot (Figure 3A). The 421 DEGs were further subjected to functional enrichment analysis. The top five significant GO terms associated with the DEGs were ""nucleosome assembly, "" ""chromatin assembly, "" ""nucleosome organization, "" ""chromatin organization involved in negative regulation of transcription, "" and ""negative regulation of gene expression, epigenetic"" (Figure 3B). The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that these DEGs were related to alcoholism, malaria, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, systemic lupus erythematosus, and viral carcinogenesis ( Figure 3C).


Construction and Validation of an ITH-Related Prognostic Signature

Based on the ITH-related genes, we constructed an ITH-related prognostic signature. First, we identified 53 survival-related genes by using univariate Cox regression analysis. Then, five ITH-related prognostic genes were further screened through LASSO Cox regression analysis (Figures 4A,B). The COAD patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 226) or a validation cohort (n = 226) at a ratio of 1:1. Then, we calculated the risk score of each patient, and the COAD patients were separated into high-and low-risk groups based on the median risk score. The distribution plot of the risk scores for the high-and low-risk groups is shown in Figure 4C. The survival times for the COAD patients are displayed in Figure 4C. The heatmap showed the expression profiles of five crucial genes in the high-and low-risk groups ( Figure 4C). In addition, the KM survival curves indicated that the survival time for the low-risk group was markedly longer than that for the high-risk group (Figure 4D). The areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival were 0.64, 0.74, and 0.77, respectively, which revealed that the ITH-related prognostic signature might effectively predict the outcomes of patients with COAD ( Figure 4E).

To further validate the universality of the prognostic signature, we conducted a similar analysis in the validation cohort and the entire cohort. The risk score for each patient was calculated using the same formula. The distribution of the risk scores, survival times of the patients, and ITH-related prognostic gene expression profiles are shown in Figure 4F and Supplementary Figure S2A. The high-risk group had a poorer prognosis than the low-risk group in both the validation cohort and the entire cohort ( Figure 4G; Supplementary Figure S2B 


Correlation Between the Prognostic Signature and Clinical Features

As displayed in Figure 5A, we analyzed the associations between the risk scores and clinical features, such as age, gender, and stage. We found that the expression level of CEACAM5 decreased with increasing risk score, whereas the expression level of MC1R increased with increasing risk score. We further analyzed the value of the risk score between the two groups stratified by different clinical features. Figure 5B illustrates that the correlation of age and risk score was not statistically significant (p = 0.24). As shown in Figure 5C, our results indicated that the correlation of gender and risk score was not statistically significant (p = 0.11). In addition, Figure 5D shows that the risk scores were significantly different between the stage I and stage III groups (p < 0.05) and between the stage I and stage IV groups (p < 0.05). In brief, the risk scores different among different stage groups, and the association of stage and risk score was statistically significant.


Construction of a Clinical Nomogram for Predicting Survival

To determine whether the prognostic signature was an independent prognostic factor for COAD, we performed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses (Supplementary Figures S3A,B). Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that the risk score was highly correlated with OS [hazard ratio (HR): 2.75, 95% CI: 1.81-4.20, p < 0.001]. Moreover, multivariate Cox regression analysis further indicated that the risk score could be used to independently predict the prognosis of COAD patients (HR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.45-3.36, p < 0.001). Subsequently, our prognostic nomogram integrating the risk score, age, and stage was constructed to estimate the 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS for COAD patients (Figure 6A). The calibration curve indicated that the actual observation vs. prediction rates for 1-, 3-and 5-year OS demonstrated excellent consistency ( Figure 6B). The AUCs of the nomogram for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS were 0.754, 0.796, and 0.766, respectively, which were higher than the values for any of the individual factors ( Figure 6C). Moreover, the DCA curves indicated that the clinical nomogram with diverse clinical features provided more net benefits in predicting the prognosis of COAD patients than any individual factor (Supplementary Figure S3C).


Functional Analysis of the Prognostic Signature

Analysis of the correlations among the five key prognostic genes was performed by Spearman correlation analysis (Figure 7A). Our results showed that CEACAM5 was negatively correlated with ENO2, whereas GABBR1 was positively associated with MC1R. Then, a gene-gene interaction network for the five key prognostic genes was constructed by using the GeneMANIA website. The function of these genes was primarily associated with the phosphatidylcholine metabolic process, the glucose catabolic process, NADH regeneration, and the NADH metabolic process (Figure 7B). PCA indicated a clear distribution between the high-and low-risk groups (Figure 7C). To explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the ITH-related prognostic signature, ssGSEA was used to analyze the high-and low-risk  groups. The enrichment results indicated that the hallmark genes of the apical junction, apical surface, and hedgehog signaling were activated in the high-risk group, whereas the hallmark genes of oxidative phosphorylation, bile acid metabolism, and peroxisome were activated in the low-risk group (Figure 7D).


Interrelationship Between the ITH-Related Prognostic Signature and Immune Cell Infiltration

We comprehensively analyzed the correlation between the ITHrelated prognostic signature and 22 tumor-infiltrating immune cells using the CIBERSORT algorithm. The immune landscape of the TCGA-COAD samples is shown in Figure 8A. By comparing and analyzing the immune cell profiles, we observed that M0 macrophages were more highly infiltrated in the high-risk group. Conversely, resting memory CD4+ T cells, activated memory CD4+ T cells, and resting dendritic cells were significantly higher in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group (Figure 8B). In addition, the low-risk group had a lower stromal score, immune score, and ESTIMATE score but a higher tumor purity score than the high-risk group (Figure 8C). We applied the ssGSEA algorithm to the RNA sequencing data for the COAD samples to evaluate immune cell infiltration and related functions. Our results showed that the populations of activated dendritic cells (aDCs), B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) were higher in the highrisk group (Figure 8D). Moreover, we analyzed the expression of MHC molecules and found that they were higher in the highrisk group (Figure 8E). An antitumor immune response must initiate a cascade of stepwise events to effectively eliminate cancer cells (19). To further analyze the impact of immune cells on COAD, the immune activity score of each step was calculated by RNA expression data and TIP analysis. Then, we compared the differences in the scores for the seven steps between the highand low-risk groups. The results indicated that the abundance of antitumor immune cells was lower in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group (Figure 8F).


Analysis of the Chemotherapy Response and Screening of Small-Molecule Drugs

To determine the efficacy of the ITH-related prognostic signature as a biomarker to predict the therapeutic response in COAD patients, we estimated the IC50 values of common anticancer drug agents between the high-and low-risk groups using the pRRophetic algorithm ( Figure 9A). The sensitivity to many chemotherapeutic drugs differed significantly between the highand low-risk groups (p = 0.023 for bleomycin, p < 0.001 for gefitinib, p<0.001 for nilotinib, p = 0.026 for pazopanib, p = 0.00035 for rapamycin, p = 0.00086 for sorafenib, p = 0.035 for temsirolimus, p = 0.0099 for vinblastine).

In addition, we screened potential small-molecule drugs for COAD using the cMap database. By analyzing the DEGs between the low-and high-risk groups, we identified 138 upregulated and 94 downregulated genes ( Figure 9B). Based on these DEGs, five potential compounds, namely, AS-605240 (Figure 9C), AS-703026 (Figure 9D), baeomycesic acid (Figure 9E), CGP-7930 (Figure 9F), and RX-821002 (Figure 9G), were screened as potential targeted drug candidates for COAD patients.


Expression of Prognostic Genes

We obtained the mRNA and protein expression levels of five key prognostic genes based on the UALCAN database and HPA database. In Figure 10A, we observed that the mRNA expression levels of CEACAM5 and SLC44A4 were significantly elevated in normal tissues compared with tumor tissues. In contrast, the levels of ENO2, GABBR1, and MC1R were  significantly elevated in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. Similarly, IHC confirmed that the protein expression levels of CEACAM5, ENO2, GABBR1, and SLC44A4 had the same tendency ( Figure 10B).


DISCUSSION

COAD is one of the most malignant tumors in the world, causing more than 850 000 deaths annually (20). Improving the prognosis of COAD is clinically challenging due to its high heterogeneity and metastatic potential (21). ITH endows tumors with multiple abilities and biological properties that make them more prone to metastasis, recurrence, and drug resistance and is therefore considered one of the key reasons for cancer treatment failure (8,22). A recent study extensively characterized ITH in wholegenome sequences of 2,658 cancer samples across 38 cancer types and revealed some underlying drivers (5). However, a comprehensive understanding of ITH requires more research.

Although the role of ITH in the initiation of COAD has been well documented, the extent to which ITH influences the prognosis and treatment strategies for COAD patients remains unclear. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the prognosis, immune microenvironment, and chemotherapy response of COAD patients based on the ITH score. We constructed an ITH-related prognostic signature based on the ITH score. Our results indicated that the ITH-related prognostic signature is an independent prognostic factor for predicting the OS of COAD patients. Furthermore, we showed that the ITH-related prognostic signature is valuable for predicting the immune microenvironment and chemotherapy response in COAD.

In the current study, our prognostic signature consisted of five ITH-related genes, namely, CEACAM5, ENO2, GABBR1, SLC44A4, and MC1R. The five-gene signature has good performance in prognosis prediction. It has been reported that these five key prognostic genes are related to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. CEACAM5 is a cell-surface glycoprotein that is normally expressed on epithelial cells in numerous organ systems (23). The high expression of CEACAM5 in colorectal cancer cells is closely associated with the CD133-positive colorectal cancer stem cell phenotype (24). ENO2 functions not only as a glycolysis enzyme but also as a critical activator of other oncogenic pathways (25,26). The low expression level of ENO2 in colon cancer is associated with a good prognosis (27). GABBR1 is a seven-transmembrane receptor that is localized on chromosome 6p21.3 within the HLA class I region close to the HLA-F gene (28). MiR-106a/b, miR-20a/b, and miR-17 have been reported to be involved in the invasion and proliferation of colorectal cancer by targeting their common target gene GABBR1 (29). SLC44A4 is a member of the family of solute carrier proteins, which are normally expressed on the apical surface of secretory epithelial cells (30). The latest research indicates that SLC44A4 may be a potential target for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (31). MC1R has been relevant to an increased susceptibility to skin cancer (32). In addition, MC1R antagonists and agonists might be employed as potential therapeutic drugs for skin cancer (33,34). MC1R plays a pivotal role in the progression of colorectal cancer and may serve as a marker of worse prognosis in colorectal cancer (35). Accordingly, our prognostic signature may have the potential to be a novel biomarker and provide new insights into the mechanisms of COAD from the prospect of ITH.

We used X-tile software to obtain the optimal cutoff value of the ITH score and divided the COAD patients into high-and low-ITH groups. The OS of patients in the high-ITH group was worse than that of patients in the low-ITH group. Subsequently, we performed subgroup analysis by age, gender and stage and found that the patients in the low-ITH group had better OS than those in the high-ITH group. In addition, the patients in the low-risk group had better OS than those in the highrisk group in the training cohort, validation cohort, and entire cohort. The AUC values for 3-year survival in the training cohort and validation cohort were 0.74 and 0.67, respectively, indicating that the model has better predictive ability than similar prognostic models in other studies (AUC = 0.63, AUC = 0.585) (36,37). Then, we identified the risk score as an independent prognostic factor by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. We constructed a nomogram by integrating the risk score, age, and stage. The results confirmed the stability and reliability of the nomogram in predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS in COAD patients. In brief, the AUC value of the nomogram was significantly better than that of other clinical factors, indicating that the nomogram can guide clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of COAD.

The tumor microenvironment is composed of tumor cells, various infiltrating immune cells, stromal cells, and cytokines (38). With the continuous in-depth study of the tumor microenvironment, the important role of infiltrating immune cells in the occurrence, development, metastasis, recurrence, and immune escape of COAD has been highlighted (39). Therefore, infiltrating immune cells may be a promising therapeutic target (40). In this study, we analyzed the types and proportions of infiltrating immune cells in the high-and low-risk groups through the CIBERSORT algorithm. Our results showed that resting memory CD4+ T cells, activated memory CD4+ T cells and dendritic cells were enriched in the low-risk group compared with the high-risk group. An increased density of CD4+ T cells is considered a marker of good prognosis, which may explain the better prognosis of the low-risk group (41,42). Furthermore, the proportion of macrophages was significantly increased in the high-risk group compared with the low-risk group. Increased macrophages are related to a poor prognosis because of their pivotal role in innate immunity (43,44). Stromal cells and immune cells are important components of the tumor microenvironment, and stromal and immune scores are relevant to the prognosis of COAD (45). Through the ESTIMATE algorithm, we estimated the stromal score, immune score, and ESTIMATE score of the high-and low-risk groups based on the ITH-related prognostic signature. Our results showed that the stromal score, immune score, and ESTIMATE score of the highrisk group were significantly elevated compared with those of the low-risk group. This suggests that ITH may participate in the tumor microenvironment, thereby affecting the occurrence and development of tumors. In summary, the ITH-related prognostic signature was significantly associated with immune cell infiltration and may be helpful for immunotherapy and targeted therapy of COAD patients.

Chemotherapy remains one of the main modalities for treating COAD (46,47). However, accumulating evidence suggests that chemotherapy resistance is a major cause of increased recurrence and mortality in COAD patients,  preventing patients from benefiting from standard treatment regimens (48,49). In this study, we performed chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity analysis for patients in the high-and lowrisk groups based on the GDSC database. The patients in the high-risk group were more sensitive to bleomycin, gefitinib, nilotinib, pazopanib, rapamycin, and vinblastine. Loss of ErbB3 expression in poorly differentiated colorectal cancer cells increases sensitivity to gefitinib (50). Nilotinib may benefit colorectal cancer patients by targeting DDR1 kinase (51). In contrast, the patients in the low-risk group were more sensitive to sorafenib and temsirolimus. Sorafenib can be used to treat colorectal cancers resistant to irinotecan-based chemotherapy by inhibiting the ABCG2 drug efflux pump (52). Temsirolimus enhances the efficacy of cetuximab in the treatment of colon cancer by targeting CIP2A expression (53). Additionally, we predicted five small-molecule drugs that could potentially be used to treat COAD patients based on the DEGs between the high-and low-risk groups. AS-605240 is a PI3Kγ selective inhibitor that attenuates chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity and breast tumor growth (54). The MAP kinase inhibitor AS-703026 in combination with everolimus can induce apoptosis of melanoma cells (55). Baeomycesic acid exerts antiproliferative effects on twelve different human cancer cell lines (56). The GABA(B) receptor-positive allosteric modulator CGP-7930 can exert antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in animal models (57). As a selective α2-adrenoceptor antagonist, RX 821002 prevents mustard oil-induced ectopic suppression of reflexes by blocking α2-adrenoceptors (58). Here, we predicted five potential small-molecule compounds for COAD that may contribute to the development of new diagnosis and treatment plans.

It is important to note the limitations of the present study. First, we only constructed and validated the signature using retrospective data from the TCGA database, and a multicenter and large-scale prospective study should be carried out to explore its clinical value in the future. Second, further in vivo studies are required to explore the five selected genes in the development of COAD. Finally, the extensive association of the signature with multiple drugs warrants our focus on screening potential therapeutic drugs.


CONCLUSION

In summary, we constructed a novel ITH-related prognostic signature that can be used to accurately predict survival time in COAD patients. A nomogram integrating clinical factors and the risk score can serve as a rapid initial diagnostic tool for predicting the OS of COAD patients. Furthermore, our signature has implications for the tumor microenvironment and chemotherapy response, which may have valuable clinical significance for improving the effectiveness of treatments, guiding treatment decisions, and saving medical resources.

X-ray crystallography

The X-ray intensity data were measured on a Bruker Apex II CCD diffractometer. Cell dimensions, and the orientation matrix were initially determined from a least-squares refinement on reflections measured in three sets of 20 exposures, collected in three different ω regions, and eventually refined against all data. A full sphere of reciprocal space was scanned by 0.3° ω steps. The software SMART 1 was used for collecting frames of data, indexing reflections and determination of lattice parameters.

The collected frames were then processed for integration by the SAINT program, 1 and an empirical absorption correction was applied using SADABS. 2 The structures were solved by direct methods (SIR 2014) 3 and subsequent Fourier syntheses and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F 2 (SHELXTL), 4 using anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms. The aromatic, methylene, methine and methyl hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions, refined with isotropic thermal parameters U(H) = 1.2 Ueq(C) or U(H) = 1.5 Ueq(C methyl ) and allowed to ride on their carrier carbons.

Molecular drawings were generated using Mercury. 5 Figure S1. Determination of the relative stereochemistry of 2-methoxy tetrahydropyran 9b through Xray crystallographic analysis (thermal ellipsoids are drawn at 30% of the probability level).

Cis-stereopreference in tetrahydropyrans 9

The favored cis relative stereochemistry established by X-ray crystallographic analysis for product 9b was extended to the other tetrahydropyrans 9a and 9c obtained using the same stereoselective synthetic approach (Scheme S1).

Scheme S1. Reagents and conditions: Pd/C (20% w/w), H 2 (filled balloon), MeOH, rt, 12-16 h.

In Scheme S2 we present a hypothesis which could explain the cis-stereopreference in the construction of tetrahydropyrans 9.

Scheme S2. Hypothesis justifying the cis-stereoselective synthesis of tetrahydropyran 9a.


Susceptibility test on Leishmania promastigotes with 10% FBS in the HOMEM assay medium

As the 20% FBS that is employed in the assay medium is a very nutrient-and antioxidant-rich environment, which could potentially prevent a stronger activation of endoperoxides 2 in comparison to the non-peroxidic analogs 3, we performed additional susceptibility tests for selected compounds by employing L. donovani cultures in HOMEM 10% FBS and we compared the results with those obtained by employing 20% FBS.

We observed a slight reduction of the IC 50 of all the tested compounds with 10% FBS in the assay medium as compared to 20% FBS. However, the bioactivities of endoperoxides 2 and tetrahydropyrans 3 remained comparable, suggesting a not significant pharmacophoric role of the O-O bond also under these bioassay-conditions. The antioxidant-rich environment (ie 20% FBS) does not appear to play a significant role in blocking the activation of endoperoxides. We can speculate that the increased antileishmanial activity of both peroxides and tetrahydropyrans in the presence of 10% FBS can be caused by a decreased parasite vitality with lower FBS concentration. 


S7


Cytotoxicity in THP-1 cell line

We performed additional cytotoxicity tests employing THP-1 cell line. We also calculated the corresponding selectivity indexes, as the ratio between CC 50 of THP-1 cell line and IC 50 on amastigotes of L. donovani.

We found that three compounds 3a, 3d and 2d showed a slightly higher cytotoxic effect on THP-1 cells than on VERO cells. On the other hand, compounds 2a, 3b and 2b showed a lower cytotoxic effect on THP-1 cells than on VERO cells; thus showing a not significant variance of selectivity index. 


S8


Effect of iron chelator DFO on bioactivity of 2b and 3b

As for compounds 2a and 3a, we evaluated the bioactivity of tetrahydropyran 3b and endoperoxide 2b   


Effect of the iron chelator DFP on bioactivity of 2a and 3a

To investigate the role of iron in the activation of compounds 2a and 3a, we also tested these compounds against promastigotes of L. donovani in the presence of the iron chelator Deferiprone (DFP), which is a more lipophilic iron-chelator than DFO. IC 50 (DFP) = 219 M; CC 50 (DFP) = 143 M. Also in this case, we observed a not significant variation of the IC 50 values when the concentration of the iron-chelator was modified. At the highest concentration of the iron-chelator, the lowest IC 50 was recorded, confirming the activity of these compounds even in the absence of low molecular weight iron-species.

3.4 7.5 S11 As shown in isobolograms depicted in Figure S3, we observed a not significant variation of the IC 50 values when the concentration of the iron-chelator increased. FIC values for both compounds are > 0.5 and < 4, therefore no antagonism or synergism was observed. 


S12


Calculated LogP

The LogP values of the compounds tested on L. donovani promastigotes were calculated using the software ChemDraw Professional 15.0.

Figure S2 .
S2tested as racemates. b IC 50 represents the concentration of a compound that causes 50% growth inhibition. DFO = desferrioxamine. The isobole technique depicts synergistic (FIC values < 0.5) or antagonistic (FIC values > 4.0) interactions between DFO and the two tested compounds. Has shown in Figure S2, combination of DFO with 2b or 3b resulted in additive effects, since no antagonism or synergism was observed. The same trend of compounds 2a and 3a was confirmed.

While COVID-19 is still ongoing and associated with more than 5 million deaths, the scope and speed of advances over the past year in terms of scientific discovery, data dissemination, and technology have been staggering. It is not a matter of ""if"" but ""when"" we will face the next pandemic, and how we leverage technology and data management effectively to create flexible ecosystems that facilitate collaboration, equitable care, and innovation will determine its severity and scale. The aim of this review is to address emerging challenges that came to light during the pandemic in health care and innovations that enabled us to adapt and continue to care for patients. The pandemic highlighted the need for seismic shifts in care paradigms and technology with R ESUM EDisparities in Equitable Care Exposed: Addressing the Gap With TechnologyThe COVID-19 pandemic unmasked deep-rooted inequities in health access and outcomes globally. Many contemporary studies have found that when adjusted for confounders, such as socioeconomic status, insurance coverage, and site of care, the differences in race are largely attenuated. Black, Hispanic and Indigenous individuals are over-represented in COVID-19 hospitalisations and mortality. In the USA, 1 in 390 Indigenous Americans and 1 in 555 Black American have died compared with 1 in 665 White Americans. 3 Members of these racialised communities are more likely to rely on higher-risk employment, delay seeking health care owing to financial constraints, reside in multigenerational housing, and receive unequal treatment once

Over the past century, the world has experienced a number of pandemics with varying impacts on health care and the global economy. The 1918 influenza outbreak was the most severe in recent history, resulting in an estimated 50 million deaths worldwide. A similar prevention approach was used during the beginning of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with control efforts limited to isolation, quarantine, and reducing the size of public gatherings. 1 COVID-19 is still ongoing and associated with more than 5 million deaths. During this time, the scope and speed of advances in terms of scientific discovery, data dissemination, and technology have been staggering. The World Health Organisation was first informed of the unusual rates of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, on December 30, 2019. Within 11 days, the genome of the coronavirus was sequenced and shared online for global collaboration efforts. 2 In this review, we address emerging challenges that came to light during the pandemic in health care delivery and innovations that helped health services adapt to COVID-19. We discuss the promise that digital health (DH) technologies hold and the importance of addressing its limitations in order to harness these innovations. There have been a number of lessons learned from this pandemic that will prepare us for the next one. It is not a matter of if but when we will face the next pandemic; how we leverage technology and data management effectively to create flexible ecosystems that facilitate collaboration, equitable care, and innovation will determine the severity and scale of future threats to our provision of health care.

hospitalised. 4,5 Despite stay-at-home orders to contain the spread of the virus, many essential workers were unable to work from home. Rogers et al. found that compared to Whites, Blacks were more likely to work essential jobs during COVID-19, including transportation, food preparation, health care support, and cleaning services, thereby increasing their risk of exposure from the workplace and transmission in their respective communities. 6 Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, reports demonstrated increased morbidity and mortality among patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). 7 These at-risk patients were advised to stay home as much as possible, to limit their chances of contracting COVID-19. However, this was not always possible, for the reasons described above. COVID-19 has seen a sharp reduction in hospital visits by patients with multiple comorbidities, those who historically had a higher utilisation of hospital care than the general population. This suggests that both missed and postponed care led to a greater disparity in health care and may lead to poorer outcomes in the longer term. 8 The pandemic highlighted the need for seismic shifts in care paradigms and technology used as a means to deliver this change. In the next section we evaluate challenges that emerged during the COVID-19 era.


Challenges to Providing Pandemic Health Care


Digital divide

As there was a pivot to providing more care using telehealth technologies, both to protect patients by reducing their contact with in-person review and to mitigate extreme hospital workloads, a number of challenges related to uptake of digital solutions were encountered. These included access to reliable internet connections and a lack of readiness for adoption of virtual care in those from minority groups or older populations. 9 Access to reliable internet. High-speed reliable internet has become an essential resource during this pandemic, whether to facilitate working from home, telemedicine, online purchases, or social communication. It has recently been recognised as an additional social determinant of health. 10 Yet in Canada, only one-fourth of Indigenous communities have access to broadband internet, compared with 97% of urban households. 11 Similarly, in the USA the digital disenfranchisement is highest among rural residents, Black and Hispanic communities, and those with the lowest income (< $50,000/year). 12 The majority of access to internet services in Canada is through internet-enabled mobile devices. Access to the internet from home reduces sharply for Canadians aged > 65 years. 11 Rural communities and First Nations reserves also suffer from a reduction in provision in broadband internet and LTEemobile phone connectivity. 13 Readiness for adoption. Access to the internet does not translate into adoption. In a recent cross-sectional study including 4,525 community adults, 38% of seniors aged > 65 years and 72% of those aged > 85 years were not able to undertake video consultations for clinic visits. Unreadiness was more prevalent among older single men, non-White counterparts, those with lower education status, and those who resided in nonurban areas. Lack of familiarity with the technology, lack of a stable internet connection, and difficulty with hearing/seeing, holding the device, and language were identified as barriers to video visits. 14 


Health literacy

In the Canadian context, health literacy is defined as ""the ability to access, understand, evaluate, and communicate information as a way to promote, maintain and improve health in a variety of settings across the life-course."" 15 Low health literacy is commonly associated with older age, lower levels of education, and minority status. [16][17][18] Even when accounting for confounders, low health literacy is a key determinant in survival, with low health literacy associated with a 75% higher risk of mortality. 18 The effects of limited health literacy can manifest in many ways, including more frequent drug errors and reduced patient understanding of their own health considerations related to the digital divide and health literacy for digital health interventions to reach full potential and improve health outcomes. We discuss advances in telemedicine, remote patient monitoring, and emerging wearable technologies. Despite the promise of digital health, we emphasise the importance of addressing its limitations, including interpretation challenges, accuracy of findings, and artificial intelligenceedriven algorithms. We summarise the most recent recommendation of the Virtual Care Task Force to scaling virtual medical services in Canada. Finally, we propose a model for optimal implementation of health digital innovations with 5 tenets including data management, data security, digital biomarkers, useful artificial intelligence, and clinical integration. lumière durant la pand emie et les innovations qui nous ont permis de nous adapter et de continuer à offrir des soins aux patients.

conditions, for example, not knowing when to seek assistance as their condition is deteriorating. 17,19 Dealing with a fast-moving situation, such as a newly emerging pandemic, required patients to be adaptable, embracing new information, particularly digital information, as experience with the disease grew. Patients needed to become accustomed to new models of care at the same time. It is unclear how well these requirements were met during the COVID-19 era, using vaccination as an example, with the initial lag, particularly among low-income and rural Canadian residents, who were more likely to have lower levels of health literacy. 20,21 Data from Ontario in 2016 showed that 47% of provincial residents had low indices of health literacy, reducing their ability to navigate the health care system and be proactive in managing their own care. 22 These were important considerations in the evolving care paradigms seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.


Evolution of health care practices

To enable the evolution of patient care during a pandemic, there must be a change in how health care professionals (HCPs) deliver care. Few professional curricula include detailed education for doctors, nurses, and other HCPs on how to successfully use digital technologies. The uptake of health care innovation is often championed by a few enthusiasts without consideration of how such technology might be best integrated into the routine workings of clinics. There is little included in medical curricula at either undergraduate or postgraduate levels nor opportunities in continuing medical education to learn techniques required for providing routine care with the use of digital technologies. In a recent selfreported survey of Canadian cardiology residents, respondents reported a lack of comfort and a need for telemedicine-targeted education during medical training. 23 Accelerated specialty-focused telemedicine curricula have been feasible in the ambulatory pediatric setting and would be readily transferrable to the adult setting. In that study, sessions delivered via Zoom included the basic principles of telemedicine communication, technical skills, and physical examination. Direct observation by attendees was also developed for evaluation purposes. 24 There was a significant increase in residents' self-reported efficacy in performing key components of telemedicine visits. Another study demonstrated that undergraduate medical students taught with the use of DH technologies were more familiar with them in their later clinical practice and more able to use such technologies in their career compared with peers who did not receive DHbased lessons during their training. 25 Beyond simply incorporating important DH and digital learning competencies into educational frameworks, such models of education will need to incorporate rapid knowledge translation and dissemination of new concepts and care paradigms that emerge at great speed in response to fresh challenges.

It is reassuring that early reports show that a move to telehealth and virtual clinics did not increase overall morbidity or mortality. 26 However, translating these digital innovations into improved outcomes compared with previous models of care in the longer term remains to be seen. 27 For DH to reach full potential, we will need a workforce trained in DH delivery and leaders with a vision to deploy changes in practice.


Innovation Through COVID-19

Pivoting to telemedicine during COVID -19 Telemedicine has been in place for decades in Canada; long on promise, it has been short on delivery. According to the Canadian Institute for Health information, before COVID-19, virtual care represented 0.15% of 270.3 million billable services. 28 Virtual care was mostly used in the private sector domain, which offered services directly to patients and providers for a fee. There was tension between patient benefits (increased access to care, cost efficiency, convenience) and provider barriers (lack of reimbursement, jurisdiction licensure restrictions, and lack of interoperability with various electronic health records). 28 COVID-19 resulted in universal adoption of telemedicine, effectively overnight. This was due to the need for a steep decline in face-to-face ambulatory visits owing to pandemic restrictions, and was supported through the use of temporary provincial billing codes. 29 In the posteCOVID-19 era, it is anticipated that patients will derive benefit from ""blended"" care with both in-person and virtual care (including telemonitoring, advanced artificial intelligence (AI), and algorithm-based care) where appropriate.

The pivot to virtual visits during COVID-19 was necessary to provide appropriate and timely care. After COVID-19, we will need to better understand appropriate patient selection for virtual care and remote patient monitoring (RPM). Moreover, we will need to appropriately evaluate the outcomes and quality in order to define what is ""good"" virtual care. A recent perspective article entitled ""Remote Patient Monitor-ingdOverdue or Overused"" highlights that while RPM can reduce cost by reducing preventable admissions and offer convenience and heightened surveillance for clinical events, there is a desperate need for research to further differentiate which patients would most derive benefit from it after the COVID-19 era. 30 In the next section, we will describe the pearls and pitfalls of RPM, using heart failure (HF) as the canonic example.


Telemonitoring in heart failure

The care of patients with HF requires frequent clinical assessments and laboratory investigations to initiate and titrate guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) as well as for the surveillance of acute decompensation. RPM engages patients as equal partners in their care and should therefore theoretically appeal to care providers and to patients with HF. 31 Despite general enthusiasm, the majority of trials that depended on traditional physiologic metrics (weight, blood pressure, and heart rate) have not improved outcomes (Table 1). In the Telemonitoring to Improve Heart Failure Outcomes (Tele-HF) study, among 1653 high risk patients, collecting daily weights and symptoms and providing daily coaching did not result in a reduction in hospitalisation compared with usual care when monitored for weight and symptoms. 32 In the first Telemedical Interventional Monitoring in Heart Failure (TIM-HF) study, despite improved adherence rates (80% of the interventional cohort had ! 70% of daily data transfers), there was no difference in all-cause mortality. 33 Common themes in these neutral trials are low adherence to the technology, poor data accuracy, and either delays or lack of actionability on data received. 34 For example, in the Tele-HF trial, 14% of patients in the active treatment arm never used the monitoring device. Furthermore, by the end of the study, only half of the patients in the active arm were using the device 3 times per week as instructed. 32 Implant-based RPM technologies used in HF have been shown to be useful for monitoring patients, but there have been challenges with costs, workflow, and responding to alerts consistently across trial populations. 35 There are often few designated protocols for action after an alert is received. This reduces the effectiveness of the system if appropriate alerts are not followed by equally appropriate alterations in patient management, including altering medications or reasserting the need for adherence to lifestyle measures such as limiting dietary intake of salt and water.

Successful remote monitoring requires adherence to schedules of data transmission, that is, it requires the patient to actually use the technology. For example, in one of the only positive telemonitoring trials, the TIM-HF2 trial, 97% of patients were 70% compliant with daily data transfer. In that trial, 1571 patients were randomised to either usual care or usual care supported by RPM. Overall, there was a borderline significant reduction in the primary end point of days lost to death or cardiovascular hospitalisation from 6.6% in the usual-care group to 4.9% in the RPM group (ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-1.00; P ¼ 0.046) but no significant difference in mortality. Interestingly, in extended follow-up 1 year after RPM was stopped, there was no longer a difference between patients previously managed with RPM and those receiving usual care, suggesting that the effect of RPM only occurred while the technology was in use. 36 This suggests that sustained benefits to patient care require ongoing engagement with RPM by both patients and clinicians.


COVID-19 heart failure RPM use case

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a decline in hospitalisations in patients with HF with each lockdown order. 42 Many feared that this downtrend would result in an increase in mortality due to delayed care as an unintended consequence of COVID-19 fear and public messaging. 43 To date this fear has not materialised; recent data have shown no differences in HF mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.97, 0.92-1.10) compared with 2019. 26 It is possible that enhanced telemonitoring and widespread adoption mitigated the indirect death toll in patients with HF during the pandemic.

Medly is a Health Canada Class II licensed software as a medical device remote patient management program used to monitor HF patients at the University Health Network, Toronto, Canada. 44 Medly uses an in-app rules-based algorithm that delivers personalised self-care messages based on daily input of weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and HFspecific symptoms. 45 Examples of the self-care feedback messages run the gamut of confirming that everything is normal, to a change in diuretic medication dose, to suggesting when patients should contact their care providers or go to the emergency department. 46 Clinical alerts are also managed by a nurse coordinator with rapid escalation to a cardiologist as needed. In a small pragmatic study, Medly was associated with a 50% decrease in HF-related hospitalisation (incidence relative ratio [IRR] 0.50; P < 0.001) and a 24% decrease in all-cause hospitalisations (IRR 0.76; P ¼ 0.02). 45 In a 2-arm randomised control pilot trial (n ¼ 42 patients) comparing Medly-enabled remote titration vs standard of care, patients randomised to remote titration were more likely to be on target or maximally tolerated doses of GDMT (angiotensin receptoreneprilysin inhibitor/angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, beta-blocker, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) at a shorter median interval (11 weeks vs 18.8 weeks; P < 0.001). Within 6 months, 86% of the intervention group compared with 48% of the control group achieved optimal GDMT (P ¼ 0.004). 47 During the COVID-19 pandemic, Medly was leveraged to provide greater support to HF clinicians undertaking remote patient management. Program evaluation has demonstrated that both patients and clinicians valued care continuity through telemonitoring and the opportunity to foster a meaningful patient-provider relationship. 48 This experience highlighted the importance of RPM being embedded in the context of the interaction with the clinic; patients who understood why they were being enrolled had more positive engagement with the technology than those who had not been introduced to the program by their usual cardiologist, highlighting the ongoing challenge of building relationships through remote methods. 49 Emerging Technologies With Potential to Revolutionise Pandemic Care

As the realm of DH continues to grow, a number of opportunities for patient management are emerging. These technologies were not as widely used during the pandemic as RPM for HF, nor have they yet provided solutions to manage the workload associated with COVID-19, but they all have potential for improving care in the future. In this next section we review wearable devices, which can provide continuous monitoring of patients and the role of AI in patient management.


Wearables: the opportunity for continuous monitoring

The interest in using technologic innovations such as ""smart wearables"" to monitor health has grown significantly over the past 5 years. 50 Smart wearables are consumer-grade devices with sensors that can be worn as an accessory or embedded into clothing. These devices include smartwatches, rings, wristbands, and pedometers. Common sensors in smart wearable devices are summarised in Table 2. Data from these devices can be processed through software algorithms to provide potentially important insights into personal health. Contrary to traditional medical models, wearables have been introduced to consumers before validation of effectiveness, safety, and reliability in the health care setting. 50,51 Currently 21% of American adults regularly wear a smartwatch or wearable fitness tracker. 52 Use is more common among women than men (25% vs 18%), among Blacks and Hispanics than Whites (23% and 25% vs 20%), and among those with higher income (31% > $75,000 vs 12% < $30,000). 52 Application of wearables in routine cardiovascular care Physical activity monitoring and cardiac rehabilitation. Physical inactivity is associated with an estimated 5 million deaths per year worldwide. 54 Increasing physical activity levels at the population level could have a substantial effect on chronic disease and increase longevity. The lockdowns and stay-at-home orders in response to COVID-19 reduced the opportunity for the general public to participate in organised sport or even attend fitness centres. Early reports indicate that patients were enthusiastic in using DH solutions to maintain their activity levels during COVID-19, and it is likely that this will continue beyond the pandemic. 55 However, prepandemic studies evaluating the efficacy of wearables have been mixed. In a randomised control trial conducted to address weight loss with the use of a wearable tracker in 470 young adults over 24 months, the intervention group lost less weight than the standard group. 56 Simply wearing a device tracker may not offer an advantage over standard behavioural approaches. A wearable tracker coupled with gamification has shown more effective results in the short-term for improving physical activity. The Behavioral Economics Framingham Incentive Trial (BE FIT) was a noncompetitive team-based intervention that offered a coffee mug as prize after a 12week intervention. The intervention group reached a higher step count compared with the control group, but the effects tapered during the postintervention period. 57 A systematic review has shown that wearable physical activity monitors can increase cardiorespiratory fitness but have little effect on sedentary time of individuals, limiting its benefits. 58 Cardiac rehabilitation, already an underutilised resource, saw further limitations to access imposed by the COVID-19 restrictions. More than 50% of Canadian programs ceased to provide any care during the first wave of the pandemic. 59 Virtual care rehabilitation, however, became a priority during this time, with the rapid delivery of cardiac rehabilitation to high-risk populations. Successful programs were able to leverage home monitoring with individualised exercise prescriptions. Wearable devices were able to be used to monitor ""moderate"" activity, albeit slightly differently depending on the wearable. 58 Using a baseline step count could support clinicians in determining weekly targeted increases in both step count and heart rate goals. 60 Heart failure. Physical activity is an important assessment in patients with HF. Traditionally, clinicians used the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class. However, this profiling is subjective with poor clinician interobserver reliability. 61 In a feasibility study, we found that a daily step count of 5000 can differentiate between patients with NYHA functional class 2 and 3 symptoms. 62 Furthermore, a study of 170 patients with HF found a step count of 4889.4 steps/ day to be a strong and independent predictor of prognosis (HR 2.28, 95% CI 1.31-6.30; P ¼ 0.008). 63 The Apple-CPET Ted Rogers Understanding Exacerbations of Heart Failure (TRUE-HF; NCT05008692) study will prospectively assess whether smartwatch physiologic and sensor data alone or in aggregate can predict objective cardiopulmonary exercise testing among 200 HF patients. 64 Wearable technologies will also be instrumental in optimising GDMT, but their utility during the pandemic has been limited. The Nanowear Heart Failure Management Multi-sensor Algorithm (NanoSense) study (NCT03719079) is investigating the SimpleSENSE monitoring undergarment and closed-loop machine learning platform (Nanowear New York, NY) in 500 patients across 5 US centres to validate its ability to identify patients at risk of HF decompensation. 65 The cloth-based nanosensor array incorporated into an undergarment allows monitoring of cardiac output and stroke volume alongside thoracic impedance, posture, and activity levels to provide a multiparametric signal of changes to a patient's HF state. With further evidence to support their efficacy, wearables may play a more useful role in future pandemics.

Atrial fibrillation, photoplethysmography, and electrocardiographic monitoring. Atrial fibrillation (AF) lends itself well to remote monitoring owing to its paroxysmal nature and critical need for stroke prevention. Smartwatches with photoplethysmography (PPG) technology coupled with algorithms to detect irregular rhythms may become integral in the screening of AF in targeted populations. During the pandemic, TeleCheck-AF was a multicentre international project launched to maintain care for patients with AF in 25 European centres. By using teleconsultations supported by an on-demand PPG-based heart rate and rhythm monitoring app (FibriCheck, Hasselt, Belgium), clinicians were able to monitor and adjust medications in the follow-up of these patients. Initial deployment of this technology was reported to be uncomplicated, but long-term outcome data are still pending. 66 Previous studies have shown some utility of wearables in detecting arrhythmia. The Huawei Heart Study enrolled 187,912 individuals to screen for AF with the use of a band or a wristwatch. Overall, 0.23% of participants received an irregular heart rhythm notification. Subsequent electrocardiography (ECG) resulted in a positive predictive value of 91.6%. 67 The Apple Heart Study was a fully virtual study, enrolling 419,297 individuals to screen for AF with the use of a PPG-based smartwatch. An irregular pulse was found in 0.52% of participants. In patients who had an irregular heart alert and returned the ECG patches, 34% had confirmed AF. 68 Hypertension and blood pressure monitoring. Hypertension remains an important risk factor in CVD, and early experience of the pandemic saw a drastic reduction in patients seeking review and optimisation of antihypertensive therapies. One study reported a 50% reduction in primary care office visits for blood pressure checks, with no difference between those with good blood pressure control and those with uncontrolled hypertension. 69 Technologies allowing home monitoring of blood pressure could help to provide care to these patients for whom in-person care is deferred.

Unfortunately, a recent review of home blood pressure measurement devices found that only a small fraction of these devices are validated. The majority of these devices are sold in online marketplaces, with 972 unique devices identified from 59 individual businesses. Of the 532 wrist-wearable devices identified, none had been validated for accuracy or performance, thus reducing the potential effectiveness of blood pressure monitoring for users. 70 Recommendations focus on development of blood pressure management programs, rather than the measurement devices themselves, advocating for a closed-loop monitoring system that can automatically send data to the clinic to inform ongoing patient management. 71 New technologies are emerging, with promise shown in using smartphone video-capture to estimate blood pressure with the use of transdermal optical imaging. Although they are still developing, better ways to detect and intervene earlier may provide improvements in preventing subsequent complications of hypertension. 72 Diabetes and blood glucose monitoring. Continuous blood glucose monitoring devices, with or without coupling to insulin delivery pumps have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for nearly a decade. 73 Used to measure capillary blood glucose levels in patients without intercurrent illness, these devices allow patients with diabetes to assess their glycemic status, receive automatic alerts when out of range, and guide their diabetes management. There was no widespread deployment of these devices during the pandemic, but the review of data from these devices suggested better diabetes control during lockdowns. It remains unclear whether this was due to better diet and self-care generally, or whether lockdowns provided individuals with an opportunity to better focus on their own health. 74 Artificial intelligence AI is defined as the ability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behaviour, whereas machine learning (ML) is the application of AI that allows a system to automatically learn and improve from experience. Deep learning is a subset of ML that uses complex algorithms and deep neural networks to train a model. 75 AI could provide support in a future pandemic through enhancing clinical assessment by the nonspecialist when access to specialist resources is limited by restrictions on travel or capacity at specialty providers. Technology-enhanced medical examination devices, such as the Eko (Oakland, CA, USA) digital stethoscope, provide an opportunity for enhanced clinical assessment. By training a deep neural network to identify murmurs from recording through the device coupled with underlying echocardiographic abnormalities, the device could identify common murmurs with an acceptable positive predictive value. Such tools could aid learners in developing their skills and assist nonexperts in obtaining useful clinical information to aid decision making from a distance. 76 Within cardiology, echocardiography is a highly specialised field that is infrequently available in rural or remote settings. AI to guide the acquisition of images is a novel focus, particularly with the emergence of point-of-care ultrasound. A deep learning algorithm trained on 5 million examples of ultrasound probe movement was applied to provide real-time guidance to novice operators. 77 Eight nurses were able to acquire 10-view transthoracic echocardiographic images at the level of sonographers. That study has significant implications for access to cardiac care in pandemic situations, in isolated communities, and in areas where travel may be restricted.


Challenges in adoption of digital technologies in health care

Interpretation challenges. There are no publicly available data on the accuracy and validation of most consumer wearables. Commercially available devices that are used to support a healthy lifestyle may not go through the same rigorous review as a medical-grade device. A recent (2020) systematic review, which included 158 articles, evaluated the accuracy of 9 different commercially available wearable device brands: Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, Mio, Misfit, Polar, Samsung, Withings, and Xiaomi. The metrics most commonly reported in the literature are mean percentage error (MPE) as defined by the actual observed values compared with the criterion standard. Devices had optimised accuracy in controlled laboratory settings. All devices measured heart rate within AE 3% on average in controlled settings; Apple Watch and Garmin were the most accurate for estimating heart rate. Fitbit, Apple Watch, and Samsung devices measured steps accurately. Energy expenditure was poorly estimated across all devices. One of the most relevant limitations of that review was the inclusion of discontinued and outdated devices, such as Apple Watch Series 2, which is several generations behind the currently available Apple Watch Series 6 device. 78 Accuracy of findings. There have been a number of questions raised over the accuracy of wearable devices, particularly with PPG technology. In the SmartWATCHes for Detection of Atrial Fibrillation (WATCH AF) study, 22% of participants were excluded from analysis because of poor-quality PPG recordings. 79 The detection of AF is always more challenging at higher heart rates, so the effectiveness is often context dependent, presenting a challenge in detecting arrhythmia, which has a low incidence across the general population while older populations who have a higher incidence of AF are less likely to be using wearable devices. 80 Further areas of inaccuracies with PPG technology deriving heart rate and oxygen saturation relate to 1) skin tone, 2) motion artefacts, and 3) signal crossover. 81,82 Future steps consist of defining who would most benefit from tracking, establishing modern standards for the evaluation of sensors, and collaborating with industry to ensure improvement of reach and accuracy in people of colour.

Clinical implications. The lack of robust evaluation of the clinical outcomes associated with wearable-detected abnormal findings and the uncertain impact of treating those findings is a significant challenge for clinicians. Using the example of pacing deviceedetected arrhythmia, for which recent studies have shown that limited episodes of asymptomatic AF do not necessarily warrant stroke prophylaxis treatment with anticoagulation, physicians remain unsure about what thresholds of wearable-detected arrhythmia are important and require treatment. 83,84 The role of wearable-detected HF parameters in management of HF patients remains at the investigation stage. The only significant evidence of benefit arises from continuous glucose monitoring devices. Evidence of benefit of these technologies, in terms of both clinical results and acceptability to patients, are needed before wearable use can be generalised into mainstream cardiovascular patient management.

Artificial intelligenceedriven algorithms. ML was used during the pandemic largely to identify early signs of COVID-19 illness. Many of the reported studies were hampered by methodologic flaws that prevented generalisability. Algorithms used small datasets with lowquality data and limited diversity, and in certain reports the same data set was used for training and validation. 85 These limitations mirror the experience of ML-driven cardiology research. In 2020, nearly 1 in every 1000 new papers indexed on Medline was about AI or ML in cardiology. 86 Despite the early excitement, even from the World Health Organisation, of using AI to deal with the pandemic, it provided few useful solutions. 87 Patient populations included in training databases still do not accurately reflect the populations being treated in routine clinical practice, a feature that has affected conventional clinical trials for decades. 88 Until these data sources are inclusive and bias free, the algorithms developed based on them will remain flawed. AI-enhanced clinical decision tools could help us achieve more meaningful and efficient interactions with patients. Unfortunately, though, current AI technologies in cardiology are still at the ""hype"" stage and will require rigorous validation with robust scientific research in diverse populations to demonstrate safety and generalisability. 89 Implementation. There is a critical role for an implementation plan at the pre-prototype stage as a roadmap outlining the timelines, resources, and deliverables. 90 As DH interventions (DHIs) emerge, they undergo an intervention maturation life cycle. Early stages of the prototype require evaluations related to end-user interfacing (usability) and feasibility of the technology. As the intervention produces consistent outputs, systematic evaluations of efficacy and effectiveness are necessary to assess the impact of the intervention. In later stages, a DHI may undergo economic and health technology assessments to appraise their affordability in the health care system. As the technology continues to mature, a DHI may then undergo wider-scale adoption within the health stream and policy environment (implementation science). Most DHIs do not reach the larger real-world implementation scale, and this maturation life cycle may take decades to evolve. 90 Lessons Learned From COVID-19 and Future Aspirations DH offers an opportunity to counter the effects of a future pandemic if lessons are learned from the role it played in dealing with the effects of COVID-19. Health care systems were quick to pivot to technology-enhanced solutions to Develop national standards for patient health information access. Support the efforts of the Federation of Medical Regulatory Authorities of Canada to simplify the registration and licensure processes for qualified physicians to provide virtual care across provincial and territorial boundaries. Encourage provincial and territorial governments and provincial and territorial medical associations to develop fee schedules that are revenue neutral between in-person and virtual encounters. Engage the CanMEDS consortium in incorporating and updating virtual care competencies for undergraduate, postgraduate, and continuing professional development learners. Develop a standardised pan-Canadian lexicon for virtual care. patient management; although the success, or otherwise, of this approach has yet to be fully evaluated, several key factors have aided this change in the care paradigm. There are issues that need to be addressed to improve the utility of DH in future pandemic management, including mitigation of the disproportionate effects of future pandemics on vulnerable populations. Specific actions recommended to limit the spread of COVID-19 included addressing the intermediate layers of the determinants of health (ie, housing, job, and food security) and supporting broad access to computers and free internet to reduce the digital divide. 4,5,28 Alterations in how care is provided, including increased use of telehealth and digital innovation, should be co-designed and include patients at the outset to ensure their needs are met. Often reinventing the wheel is not necessary; for example, in the months before COVID-19 took hold in Canada, the Virtual Care Task Force created by the Canadian Medical Association, the College of Family Physicians of Canada, and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada released its recommendations for scaling up virtual medical services. 91 Their 5 key recommendations from February 2020 are summarised in Table 3.

A rapid review of DH solutions and remote monitoring technologies used in response to COVID-19 identified perceived benefits, including a lower burden of care for hospitals and HCPs, reduced infection risk for patients, and support for vulnerable populations. At the same time, barriers to implementation included equity-related barriers (affordability of technology for users, poor internet connectivity, poor health literacy), the need for quality best-practice guidelines for use of RPM, and the need for additional resources to develop and support technology solutions. 92 Innovation in patient management and alteration of paradigms of health care delivery were successful, but not all opportunities were utilised to their fullest extent. There remains a gap between use of DH innovation and its integration into routine clinical practice through evidence-based implementation practices. We propose 5 important steps required to bridge this gap, creating a model for how future virtual clinics could be organised (Fig. 1).


Data management

Many digital solutions currently involve transfer of data from patient devices to clinicians for review. However, often there is no automated means of analysing the large volume of data produced from wearable technologies. Any data that are submitted by patients for clinical review must be painstakingly analysed, often manually, with little in the way of a safety net to ensure correct analysis. This requires skills that are not always well developed and time on the part of the analyser to perform this task. These novel technologies should provide data that are organised with important findings highlighted by automated preprocessing. Without these filters in place, reliably identifying features of interest that clinicians can act on, HCPs will quickly lose interest and motivation in using novel technologies. Finally, current patient record systems are not geared toward archiving data received from wearables, making subsequent review to verify new findings against previous data challenging. For effective future deployment, these considerations need to be addressed as part of a system-wide approach.


Data security and access

Patients should be confident that data produced by innovative digital technologies is securely stored and can be accessed only by members of their health care teams. Furthermore, patients should have access to their own data, with appropriate support and empowerment to be able to alter their management should abnormal findings be present. This is a paradigm that has been successfully used in diabetes and HF management, where the clinical team takes on an advisory role rather than providing instruction on what to do in response to every measurement taken. These data flows will be reliant on storage in digital repositories, using cloud-based solutions. It is imperative that appropriate security standards are developed alongside interactivity frameworks to ensure meaningful use of this data while preserving privacy. Furthermore, data flows need to be effective, and this can only occur with inexpensive and readily available internet access in all parts of the country. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission have launched their ""Closing the Digital Divide"" program, aiming to achieve broadband speeds of at least 50 Mbps download and 10 Mbps upload with access to unlimited data for all Canadians. Such initiatives are key to promoting digital transformation of care. 93 Identification of effective digital biomarkers (digitome)

An important application of data preprocessing includes digital biomarkers. Digital biomarkers are physiologic and behavioural measures that explain, influence, or predict health-related outcomes, creating a personalised digitome. It may be that in the future, particular motion and movements (eg, placing a hand to the mouth while smoking) or attendance at locations (visiting a fitness centre) will aid priming of risk models for routine care, leveraging data that are currently routinely collected by wearables and other smartphone technologies. Data from sensors need to be integrated and provide contextual information, processed to help understand the clinical phenomenon being measured, and matching this to clinical need to produce useful digital biomarkers. 94 These digital biomarkers will need to demonstrate validity in each population that will be treated, including those from nonurban, underserved, and vulnerable backgrounds.


Useful artificial intelligence

The promise of AI requires a systematic approach to training algorithms and ML models underpinned by rigorous methodology. Despite enthusiasm related to ML and health care automation, there are inconsistencies related to the availability of labelled data and outcomes, bias injection (eg, introduction of racial/gender bias in nonrepresentative data sets), inaccurate measurements, reproducibility, and lack of external validation. To mitigate some of these issues, the American College of Cardiology Healthcare Council put forth ""Proposed Recommendations for Cardiovascular Imaginge Related Machine Learning Evaluation"" (PRIME). 95 PRIME aims to provide a checklist for the ML community, with the goal of standardising the application of AI and ML. This framework provides recommendations, ranging from design to reporting the limitations phase that data scientists, researchers, and clinicians should adopt, to allow for the implementation of AI in clinical practice. Furthermore, the concept of ""ethical AI"" is emerging, with due consideration being given to data privacy and ownership alongside the determination of accountability for decisions now made by computers that were previously made by humans. 96,97 Although neural networks can offer important accurate diagnostic and prognostic information, algorithms should be explainable and interpretable. 86 Highly complex neural networks may yield accurate diagnostics, but it may be difficult to generalise to real-life clinical situations. 98 Moreover, health care data are particularly vulnerable to challenges where the underlying code and patient data are subject to privacy disclosure restrictions.

Coding for these algorithms should be freely available for scrutiny and external review, without compromising intellectual property rights or dissuading innovation in this field. If there is little appetite for development of such tools by the private sector, then it should be made a priority for national and international collaborations through research-funding bodies such as the Canadian Institutes of Health Research or US National Institutes of Health to ensure that patients have confidence in these AI-driven technologies.


Integration into the clinical care pathway

Without consideration of how these technologies can be integrated into the clinical pathway for patients, take-up of innovation will be suboptimal. Issues such as data management, storage, workflow for analysis, clinical decision making, and enacting changes in management plans need to be addressed. How data filters into the current model of multidisciplinary management of patients has yet to be tackled. It may be that current models of care are inadequate for dealing with future challenges, and these models will need to be proactive to maintain efficacious. The final, but no less important, driver of change in care pathways is the remuneration of clinical activity undertaken by both the HCP and the health care organisation. Without adequate reimbursement, there will always be barriers to implementation. By demonstrating the value of digital innovation to the health care economy through appropriately designed clinical evaluation studies, regulators and payers should be willing to embrace novel, evidence-based technologies.


Conclusion

COVID-19 will be remembered for the devastating number of associated deaths and long-term health consequences, and the sociodemographic divides that it unmasked. It will also be remembered as a time of opportunity, when unprecedented digital solutions were rapidly implemented into clinical practice and medical education. DH technology needs to be held to the same rigorous standards as current health care tools, with embedded quality measures to promote high-quality care, ensure that devices and digital biomarkers are valid and that AI is ethical and clear, and confirm that patient data can be securely stored and transferred to clinicians where it can provide a meaningful trigger to engage evidence-based interventions to change patient management. DH has all the potential to deliver safe, efficient, and effective care to the population as a whole, reaching parts of society who have previously been underserved to try to reduce health inequity at the same time.

Fast forward to 2025: We are now living in a poste COVID-19 era with nearly 6 billion people vaccinated. A ""new normal"" has emerged, including a transformed health care system. We follow more than half of our patients with the use of digital technologies as stand-alone or blended models of care. Reimbursement for virtual care is a permanent fixture. Technology is increasingly addressing health inequity and disparities in care. We hope.

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is known to play an important role in the health of cells and tissues. Not only are chemical signals transmitted via bonds and tightly controlled diffusion, but the structure of the ECM also provides important physical signaling for the cells attached to it. The structure is composed of a mesh of fibrous proteins, such as collagen, embedded in a hydrated gel matrix of glycosaminoglycans. To study cell behavior with respect to the combined morphology and mechanics of such matrices is not currently possible with the types of 3D cell culture matrices available. Most of the cell culture matrices are single-phase bio-or polymeric hydrogels. Therefore, here we developed a continuous hybrid manufacturing process to make fiber-reinforced composite hydrogels. A far field electrospinning process was used to deposit the fibrous component with the aid of guiding electrodes; and a gravity-assisted, droplet-based system controlled the rate of addition of the cell-laden hydrogel component. The addition of the fibrous component slightly increased the elastic modulus of the pure hydrogel. The cells that were embedded into the fiber-reinforced hydrogels were viable for 8 days. The cells were randomly placed in the matrix such that some had no contact to the fibers and others were initially in proximity to fibers. The cells with no contact to fibers grew into spheroidal clusters within the hydrogel, and those in proximity to the fibers spread out and grew along the fibers showing that the fiber-reinforced hydrogels are able to control cell behavior with morphological cues.

INTRODUCTION

The extracellular matrix (ECM) of connective tissues is composed of two distinctly different morphological components. One of these is a mesh of proteinaceous fibers, such as collagen, fibronectin, and elastin. The other is a highly hydrated gel composed of glycosaminoglycans. Together, they provide structural, biophysical, and biologically active support to the cells within this microenvironment (Theocharis et al., 2016). During the progression of solid tumors, the ECM is altered through increased fibrous protein deposition, reorganization, and cross-linking (Lu et al., 2012). The result is a stiffening, or desmoplasia, of the surrounding tissue (Croft et al., 2004). Pathologically desmoplastic tissues are a major contributor to the biomechanical properties of the tumor microenvironment (Berger et al., 2017). Although this phenomenon is frequently observed, the influence of these mechanical changes on cellular behavior toward the progression of the disease is not fully understood.

Although the mechanobiology of tumor cells is well researched (Makale, 2007), it is often done so in 2D Petri dishes where interactions of the tumor cells with the 3D fiber and gel composite structure of the ECM are ignored. This has lead to a lack of fundamental understanding of the combined effects of matrix stiffening and ECM fiber density on tumor growth. Currently, many investigations utilize reconstituted ECM proteins to mimic the physiology in vivo (Narayanan et al., 2009). Although these systems provide 3D microenvironments with native bioactivity, they lack mechanical relevance, as these biomaterials cannot produce scaffolds stiff enough to match relevant physiological or pathophysiological mechanics. Chemical modifications have been used to increase stiffness, but they introduce confounding variables that make it difficult to correctly isolate only the effects of fibers (Erikson et al., 2008). Furthermore, these techniques are unable to control the density of fibrous proteins to correctly isolate their influence on cellular behaviors. Thus, it has been a nontrivial pursuit to produce a system that can capture both morphology and mechanical properties of the evolving tumor microenvironment.

Our main goal, therefore, was to create a 3D in vitro ECM model comprised of both fiber and hydrogel components into which cells may be embedded. Furthermore, the fiber density in this model must be readily tunable to capture tissue morphologies from healthy to cancerous. A common method for producing polymeric nano-to micro-scale fibers, often used in cell-material interaction studies, is electrospinning. Typical electrospinning setups produce aligned or random mats of densely packed fibers up to generally a few hundred microns in thickness. Whereas such 2D mats may be used to explore, for example, the contact guidance behavior of cells (Nisbet et al., 2008), they do not capture the 3D nature of the in vivo environment. It has proven to be challenging to extend the electrospinning process from easily producing 2D mats to producing 3D fiber networks. Researchers have sought to expand upon the electrospun mats to create hybrid fiber-gel 3D matrices. One method has been to build layered electrospun fiber mat-hydrogel structures (McCullen et al., 2010;Jang et al., 2013;Xu et al., 2013). Briefly, an electrospun mat is covered in a coating of hydrogel and then a second electrospun mat is layered on top and covered in a coating of hydrogel, and so on. This structured approach, however, leads to an imposed layered morphology, which will a priori influence the way the cells behave. To our knowledge, only one other research group has attempted to randomly mix electrospun polymeric fibers with a hydrogel matrix. Coburn et al. (2011) report manually collecting fibers that were spun into an organic solvent and mixing them with a poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate (PEG-DA) solution before UV exposure to cure the PEG-DA gel.

Here, we report a proof-of-principle study in which we developed a continuous hybrid manufacturing process capable of creating a uniformly random fiber-reinforced hydrogel composite matrix. Without the need for layering or postelectrospinning mixing, we demonstrate the ability to tune the fiber density between samples over a wide range. The process has been designed to incorporate cells into the hydrogel component during production, therefore, fully embedding the cells in the 3D matrix.


MATERIALS AND METHODS


Manufacturing System

In order to create three-dimensional fiber-reinforced hydrogels, as opposed to mats of hydrogel-soaked electrospun fibers, we developed a continuous hybrid manufacturing process (Figure 1). The process involves the combination of farfield electrospinning of polymer fiber reinforcement with droplet deposition of the cell-infused hydrogel solution. In order to allow for the combined deposition of both the fiber reinforcement and cell-infused hydrogel droplets, the farfield electrospinning printhead was angled at 30 • off of the z-axis, while the path of the cell-infused hydrogel droplets was collinear to the z-axis. In addition, the build reservoir was also rotated about the z-axis. The major premise behind our hybrid manufacturing process is that the wavefront created by the hydrogel droplet impact (Worthington, 1882;Rein, 1993;Manzello and Yang, 2002;Yarin, 2006;Kavehpour, 2015), when combined with rotation of the reservoir, will result in the effective three dimensional distribution of the fibers.

The sequential steps of the droplet impact cycle to create the 3D fiber networks within the hydrogel matrix are as follows (Figure 2):

• Step 1: The hydrogel droplet lands on the surface of the build reservoir with its impact velocity. • Step 2: A wave front is created as the kinetic energy from the droplet is dissipated into the surrounding fluid. The wave front displaces and mixes the electrospun fibers within the three dimensional build volume.

FIGURE 2 | Sequential steps of the droplet impact cycle to create the 3D fiber networks within the hydrogel matrix.

•

Step 3: The wave front dissipates, and the next droplet in the sequence proceeds to impact the fluid surface. • Step 4: Steps 1-3 are repeated until the desired thickness of the sample is achieved. • Step 5: Upon gelation, the cross-section of the fiber network is characterized.

It should be noted the rotational motion of the build reservoir augments the mechanisms at play in Steps 2 and 3. This additional energy not only mixes the electrospun fibers in the fluid (

Step 2) but it also introduces a new deposition zone for the eletrospun fibers and hydrogel solution (

Step 3). The components of the manufacturing system include the far-field electrospinning print head the electrospinning solution syringe pump (R99, Razel, St. Albans, VT, United States), two positive-polarity, high-voltage power supplies (ES-50P, Gamma High Voltage, Ormond Beach, FL, United States), the hydrogel dispensing printhead, the hydrogel solution syringe pump (R99, Razel, St. Albans, VT, United States) with syringe heating pad and controller (New Era Pump Systems, Farmingdale, NY, United States), and build reservoir on a rotary stepper motor stage (maximum rotational speed of 30 revolutions per minute). The manufacturing system was placed inside of an environmental enclosure (Figure 3) constructed from polypropylene, due to its high electrical resistivity and chemical resistance. The following section describes the components and process methodology of the system in detail.


Electrospinning Process

The electrospinning process utilized a far-field setup, with guiding electrodes located underneath the spinneret needle. The spinneret design consists of a round, aluminum-6061-T6 alloy manifold (where the polymer solution was fed from a syringe pump). The spinneret voltage was applied to the manifold via a positive-polarity, high-voltage power supply in order to charge the polymer solution and bluntended needle (21-gauge by 12 mm long, stainless steel).

FIGURE 3 | Implementation of the hybrid manufacturing system for cell-infused fiber reinforced hydrogel production. The round shape of the manifold was selected so that it would better transmit the electric field to the collection substrate. The use of guiding electrodes has been used in previous electrospinning experiments to reduce the spread of the fiber deposition (Deitzel et al., 2001;Lee et al., 2012;Martinez-Prieto et al., 2015). With the addition of these guiding electrodes (i.e., copper rings), a second positive-polarity, high-voltage power supply was required to allow for the independent control of both the spinneret voltage (applied to the needle), and the focusing electrode voltage (applied to the rings). Here, the guiding electrodes were two solid copper rings (rolled diameter 75 mm, tube diameter of 4 mm), mounted concentric to the manifold and needle assembly. The rings were rolled to a ring diameter of 75 mm. The two copper rings were located 40 and 60 mm, respectively, below the bottom surface of the manifold.

The electrospinning process parameters used in this setup are listed in Table 1. The ground electrode, required for electrospinning, was a round sheet of aluminum foil affixed to the bottom of the build reservoir (a 100 mm diameter polystyrene Petri dish).


Hydrogel Dispensing

The hydrogel dispensing system was a gravity-assisted, dropletbased deposition system. The hydrogel solution was supplied to a dispensing head located directly above the build reservoir through the use of a syringe pump. The syringe pump supplied pressure to force a droplet to grow at the tip of a tapered polypropylene dispensing needle (14-gauge, 1.6 mm inside diameter). The height at which the hydrogel dispensing head was located above the build reservoir dictated the velocity (and energy) of the impacting droplet. This was set constant at a height of 45 cm above the build reservoir, which resulted in a droplet velocity of approximately 3 m/s. When embedding cells, they were suspended in the hydrogel at 40 • C (see section ""Hydrogel"" below) and aspirated into the syringe just before the manufacturing process began. The cellinfused hydrogel solution was maintained at a temperature of 40 • C in the syringe using the syringe heater. The entire manufacturing process for one sample lasts approximately 3 min.


Electrospinning and Hydrogel Materials

Electrospinning Solution   was dissolved in glacial acetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States). While being biocompatible, PCL suffers from exhibiting hydrophobic properties, which can inhibit cell adhesion (Liverani and Boccaccini, 2016;Mirhosseini et al., 2016). In order to improve these wetting properties, pluronic acid F-127 (concentration 1.0 wt.%) was added to the electrospinning solution. The solution was mixed for 12-18 h at 60 • C.


Hydrogel

Low gelling temperature agarose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) was dissolved in incomplete McCoys 5A (Gibco) cell culture medium. For these experiments, the concentration of agarose used was 0.3% w/v to simulate the native ECM stiffness of the cells being used (Mills et al., 2011(Mills et al., , 2014Yu et al., 2011). When creating cell-laden matrices, cells were mixed into the agarose solution at a density of 80,000 cells/mL immediately prior to deposition. After the agarose was deposited, the sample was placed in the refrigerator (4 • C) for 30 min to hasten gelation. After gelling, the sample was washed in incomplete medium three times for 5 min. The incomplete medium was then replaced with supplemented medium and the sample placed in the incubator. The washing steps removed traces of the solvent needed to create the fibers and brought the sample to physiological pH.


Cell Culture and Staining

Human colon cancer cells (HCT 116) were embedded in the fiber-reinforced hydrogels. Once cells were embedded, the samples were hydrated with McCoys 5A cell culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin. Samples were incubated at 37 • C and 5% CO 2. The cell-culture medium was changed every 48 h.

After 8 days of incubation and observation, cell-laden fiber-reinforced hydrogel samples were fixed and stained for fluorescence imaging with the confocal microscope. First, the samples were washed three times for 5 min each in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). They were then fixed overnight at 4 • C in 4% paraformaldehyde. After three more 5 min washes in PBS, the samples were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 detergent for 30 min followed by three further 5 min washes in PBS. The samples were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin solution for 30 min before incubating in rhodamine phalloidin (1:75 dilution in PBS) to stain F-actin. The nuclei were then stained with Hoechst (0.2 µg/mL, Hoechst 33342, Thermo Fisher) at room temperature in dark for 4 h.


Microscopy


For Fiber Characterization

To obtain clean cross-sections for imaging, the fiber-reinforced hydrogel samples were dehydrated and cooled prior to sectioning. The samples were dehydrated in a series baths, of increasing ethanol concentration, over a period of 24 h. The sample was first placed in a 33% ethanol bath for 8 h, a 66% ethanol bath for 8 h, and finally in a 100% ethanol bath for 8 h. Then, the samples were cooled in a refrigerator (2-4 • C) for 12 h. Finally, the samples were mechanically sectioned using a tungsten-carbide cutter. The cross-sections of these samples were imaged using an optical microscope (Zeta 20, Zeta Instruments, San Jose, CA, United States), at a magnification of 50×. Cross-sectional images were then analyzed in ImageJ image analysis software to measure the fiber diameter distribution, and fiber number density of the produced samples.


For Cell Morphological Characterization

For the cell-incorporated fiber-reinforced hydrogels, an inverted optical microscope (Axio Vert.A1, Zeiss, Jena, Germany) was used to take images daily. Ten images were captured per sample in random regions, while making sure to document cell behavior near or on fibers and away from fibers. Fluorescence images of cells and fibers were acquired with a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510 Meta, Zeiss, Jena, Germany). 


Mechanical Characterization

Micro-indentation tests were performed using a high-precision piezo-electric actuator controlled microcompression system FIGURE 7 | Summary of the micro-indentation experimental results for pure 0.3% agarose hydrogel (0% nominal fiber concentration) and 0.3% agarose hydrogel reinforced with 2.5, 5, and 10% nominal fiber concentration. The bar heights represent the average elastic modulus calculated from the Hertz contact equation fit to at least four indentation measurements on at least three separate samples for each condition. The error bars represent the standard error of the measurements. Significance was tested using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test for multiple comparisons.

(CellScale Biomaterials Testing, Waterloo, ON, Canada; Figure 4A). The hydrogels were indented with a 3 mm glass bead, which was glued to the end of cantilevered steel microbeams of 0.2032 or 0.4064 mm diameter ( Figure 4B). Indentation force, F, and depth, δ, were continuously calculated during the experiment based on the deflection of the indenter end of the cantilevered beam (measured optically) and the piezo-controlled z-displacement of the cantilevered beam's fixed end. Experimental force-indentation depth curves were fit to determine the sample's elastic modulus, E, using the Hertz contact model for a spherical indenter (Yang et al., 2007):
F = 4 3 ER 1/2 1 − ν 2 δ 3/2
where R is the radius of the indenter and ν is the Poisson's ratio, which was assumed to be 0.49 for the hydrogels (Figure 4C). When testing, fiber-reinforced hydrogel samples were kept in 60 mm Petri dishes with the walls carefully removed, and the entire sample and microbeam were submerged in PBS. The indentation and retraction rates were the same and kept constant between tests at 4 µm/s. The maximum indentation depth was 10% of the height of the sample.

RESULTS


Fiber-Reinforced Hydrogels Microscale Morphology

The use of a syringe pump allows for the volumetric flow rate of the hydrogel solution to be tailored to allow for varying fiber densities in the final fiber-reinforced hydrogel samples. Varying the volumetric flow rate of the hydrogel solution between 3.8 and 0.9 mL/min, with the electrospinning rate held constant at 0.1 mL/min, we observed nominal fiber densities between 2.5 and 10%, respectively (Figure 5).

Representative samples at the different fiber densities were selected for cross-sectioning and imaging ( Figure 6A). From these images we observed the morphology of the fibrous network and whether it was deposited uniformly through the thickness of the sample, we also measured the fiber diameter ( Figure 6B) FIGURE 9 | Comparison of phase contrast images of cell morphology away from fibers and on fibers directly after seeding on day 0 and on days 4 and 8. Scale bar is 50 µm. and fiber number density ( Figure 6C). Visually we observe ( Figure 6A) that the fibrous network uniformly penetrates the full imaged depth of the samples. The network appears to be comprised of randomly oriented fibers, both in-plane (observed as bright lines) and out-of-plane (observed as bright dots). Figure 6B displays a histogram of the measured fiber diameters pooled across all the samples, consisting of varying fiber concentrations produced (n = 9 samples). The distribution of fiber diameter followed a lognormal distribution, with a mean and standard deviation of 2.40 and 0.98 µm, respectively. No significant changes in fiber diameter were seen across samples with different fiber concentrations, as the electrospinning parameters (listed in Table 1), and electrospinning solution (detailed in section Electrospinning Solution) remained constant throughout the production of all samples.

The fiber number density was also computed for the samples produced at different fiber concentrations. Figure 6C presents value of the fiber number density (i.e., number of fibers per unit area), seen in the optical microscopy images. A total of three optical microscopy images were analyzed for each fiber concentration on the plot. As the fiber concentration increases, the fiber number density also increases. Using this process, the fiber number density increase up to ∼850 fibers per sq. mm at the highest fiber concentration (10%) that was created.


Mechanical Characterization of the Fiber-Reinforced Hydrogels

At least three samples were produced of pure 0.3% agarose hydrogel and fiber-reinforced hydrogels with fiber densities of 2.5, 5, and 10% for mechanical testing by micro-indentation. The elastic moduli for pure 0.3% agarose and 2.5% fiberreinforced hydrogel were found to be 385 ± 13 Pa and 368 ± 28 Pa, respectively, and not significantly different from one another. Upon the incorporation of higher concentrations of fibers, however, the elastic modulus rose to 1,500 ± 387 Pa with 5% fiber concentration and 3,830 ± 466 Pa with 10% fiber concentration (Figure 7). At least four indentation FIGURE 10 | Measurements of cell cluster development over 8 days. (A) The growth of cell clusters was quantified as their projected area and (B) their morphology as their aspect ratio (mean ± standard error). For cell clusters growing away from fibers, N 0 = 35, N 4 = 43, N 6 = 27, and N 8 = 12; for cell clusters growing on fibers, N 4 = 3, N 6 = 4, N 8 = 7. Significance was tested using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test for multiple comparisons ( * p < 0.05, * * p < 0.001).

Scale bar is 50 µm. measurements per sample (12 total per condition) were collected for the averages and standard errors presented here.


Cell Growth and Morphological Characterization

For this proof of principle study we chose an approximately 4% fiber concentration as we found this was an optimal density that maximized the probability of cell-fiber interaction while maintaining optical transparency of the matrix to obtain microscope images of the cells (Figure 8 and Supplementary Figure 1). In order to initiate cell-fiber contact, a cluster of cells must be embedded in proximity to a fiber or bundle of fibers. Growth and morphology of the embedded HCT-116 cell clusters were monitored over an 8 days period in the fiber-reinforced hydrogels (Figures 9, 10). Characteristic images of cell clusters growing away from and on the fibers within the hydrogels show the obvious effects of the fibers on growth morphology (Figures 9, 11). We quantified the growth rates of the cell clusters as their projected area in the micrographs and their morphology as their projected aspect ratio over 8 days of growth (Figure 10). Initially (day 0), the embedded cell clusters are not apparently attached to fibers; therefore, no data is recorded for that day and condition. Cell clusters that are away from fibers and on fibers both exhibit steady growth (Figure 10, left). The most significant effect of the presence of the fibers on cell growth, however, is the morphology. Whereas cell clusters away from the fibers maintain an approximately spherical morphology (Figure 10, right; Figure 11, top rows), the clusters on fibers extend out along the fibers and project a more elongated shape over time (Figure 10, right; Figure 11, bottom rows). Since the probability of a cell cluster being embedded in contact with a fiber is relatively low, there are significantly fewer measurements for ""on fiber"" clusters as compared to ""away from fibers"" clusters. After the 8 days growth period, the samples were fixed and stained with either Hoechst (to visualize the nuclei) or RFP phalloidin (to visualize the F-actin network). Although the characterization of cell growth and morphology has been presented here for the HCT-116 colon cancer cell line, the applicability of the method to a second cell line (MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma) is presented in the Supplementary Materials (Supplementary Figure 2).


DISCUSSION
Morphological guidance cues play an important role in determining cell behavior, from spreading and proliferation to apoptosis. It has been recognized for some time the need to culture cells in environments that more closely resemble their native 3D, soft, and structured ECM than 2D, stiff Petri dish plastic. However, the commonly used bio-and synthetic polymeric hydrogels lack the important protein fiber structures that are present in the body. Furthermore, the protein fiber structure is known to become significantly denser and stiffer due to increased deposition and cross-linking in diseases like fibrosis and cancer. Since no in vitro cell culture matrix is available that combines both the fibrous and gel components of the ECM, nor the ability to tune the fiber density and mechanical properties of the matrix, our major goal here was to produce such a matrix and demonstrate cell viability and morphological differences in it.
Here, we developed a continuous hybrid manufacturing process to make fiber-reinforced composite hydrogels. A far field electrospinning process was used to deposit the fibrous component with the aid of guiding electrodes; and a gravityassisted, droplet-based system controlled the rate of addition of the cell-laden hydrogel component. An environmental enclosure was designed in which to carry out the manufacturing of the samples to avoid contamination. For these proof of principle experiments, we used PCL for the electrospun fibers and 0.3% agarose for the gel matrix due to their ease of use and cost effectiveness, but other commonly electrospun materials and hydrogels may also be implemented with little effort.
Cells were introduced into the fiber-reinforced hydrogels by suspending them in the hydrogel solution prior to its droplet deposition. The cells were therefore randomly placed in the matrices, sometimes lying near to or on fibers and sometimes away from fibers. We tracked how the cells grew and responded with respect to their position in the gels. Obvious differences could be seen between cells that were growing away from fibers, and cells growing along fibers. Such distinctive phenotypic differences were expected. Agarose is a bioinert, non-cell-adhesive hydrogel that only provides tissue-mechanicsmimicking structural support for cell growth. Therefore, it was not surprising that cell clusters that were only in contact with this gel maintained a compacted spheroidal shape. The use of other, bioactive hydrogels would add another layer of complexity to this system. With little to no modification of the manufacturing system, other thermo-sensitive gelling materials may be used (e.g., gelatin; Supplementary Figure 3). Cells that were embedded near to or in contact with the PCL fibers, however, displayed a completely different phenotype. They attached to the PCL fibers, spreading out along them in long thin bundles. This demonstrated the ability to control cell behavior with a randomly embedded, 3D polymeric fiber mesh embedded in a hydrogel matrix. This will be a useful tool to study how cells interact with fibrotic and desmoplastic tissues, which are known to be part of the pathophysiology of tumor growth and metastasis. Excessive fibrous structures in and surrounding the tumor are known, for example, to provide highways upon which tumor cells migrate (Condeelis and Segall, 2003).
Continuous improvement of this manufacturing process will allow greater control over fiber density, and possibly fiber orientations, within the hydrogel matrix. Such fully tunable matrices will provide mechanobiologists a useful tool with which to study the interactions of cells with the ECM and determine their influence in health and disease.

MIT-CTP 4574 QCD inequalities for hadron interactions
29 Aug 2014(Dated: September 1, 2014)
We derive generalisations of the Weingarten-Witten QCD mass inequalities for particular multihadron systems. For systems of any number of identical pseudo-scalar mesons of maximal isospin, these inequalities prove that interactions between the constituent mesons must be repulsive and that no bound states can form in these channels. Similar constraints in less symmetric systems are also extracted. These results are compatible with experimental results (where known) and recent lattice QCD calculations, and also lead to a more stringent bound on the nucleon mass than previously derived, mN ≥ 3 2 mπ.

Analytic relationships between low-energy hadronic quantities are difficult to obtain in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) because it is a strongly interacting field theory, and only a few such relationships are known. Consequently, the various inequalities between hadron masses that have been derived by Weingarten [1], Witten [2], and (under some assumptions) by Nussinov [3] have an important place in our understanding of QCD. The rigorous relations can be summarised by stating that the pion is the lightest colourless state of non-zero isospin [1] (m X ≥ m π for X being any I = 1 isospin-charged meson), that the pion electromagnetic mass difference m π + − m π 0 is positive [2] and that baryons are heavier than pions, m B ≥ m π [1,4]. The status of QCD inequalities is reviewed in Ref. [5]. The known results concern a relatively small number of static quantities, and it is important to consider whether further relations exist. In this direction, Nussinov and Sathiapalan [6] found that in QCD motivated models there are relationships between scattering lengths in various two-particle channels, and Gupta et al. [7] showed that an unphysical combination of ππ interactions is attractive (a physical meaning can be given to this result in a theory with N f = 4 degenerate flavours [8]). In this letter, we demonstrate that there are additional rigorous QCD inequalities that pertain to the spectrum of physical, multi-hadron systems and thereby to the nature of the corresponding hadronic interactions.

As simple examples, we prove that there are no bound states in the I = 2 π + π + or I = 3/2 π + K + channels. As a consequence, we also improve on a previous baryonmeson mass inequality, showing that m N ≥ 3 2 m π . A central observation of Vafa and Witten [4] is that the measure of the QCD functional integrals that define correlation functions is positive definite in the absence of a θ-term or baryon chemical potential (we will ignore these cases throughout). After integrating over the quark degrees of freedom, the measure can be expressed as 
dµ = x,µ,a dA a µ (x)e −S Y M [A] f det [D / + m f ] ,(1)O(x 1 , . . . , x n ) = 1 Z dµÔ(x 1 , . . . , x n ) ,(2)
where Z = dµ, and the operatorÔ results from the operator O after integration over quark fields. These functional integrals are only defined after the imposition of a regulator, and we assume the use of a regulator that does not spoil positivity [1,4]. As a consequence of the positivity of the measure, field independent relations that are shown to hold for any particular gauge field configuration also hold for the integrated quantity, the corresponding correlation function. Vafa and Witten used measure positivity to derive the celebrated result that vector symmetries do not break spontaneously.

In related work, Weingarten [1] considered correlation functions from which meson and baryon masses can be determined, and made use of the Cauchy-Schwarz and Hölder inequalities to show that relationships exist between the corresponding functional integrals. The inequalities show that m π ≤ m X , and m N ≥ N f −2 N f −3 m π for a theory with N f ≥ 6 flavours. Using a further constraint on the spectrum of the inverse of the Dirac operator, shown to hold in Ref. [4], this latter constraint was extended to m N ≥ m π , independent of the number of flavours.

Our analysis shares similarities with the above approaches, but also makes use of an eigenvalue decomposition of correlation functions. We begin by considering an I = I z = n many-π + correlator of the form
Ω n i uγ 5d (x i ) n j dγ 5ū (y j ) Ω ,(3)
where |Ω is the vacuum state and the clusters of points {x i } and {y j } are taken to be well separated in Euclidean space. We specify to vanishing total momentum by summing over the spatial components of the y i coordinates arXiv:1408.6919v1 [hep-ph] 29 Aug 2014 and for simplicity set the temporal components x 4 i = 0 ∀i and y 4 j = t ∀j and allow for some of the source locations to be the same (nonzero correlators result provided 4N c or less quark fields are placed at the same point). This leads to
C n ≡ C n (x 1 , . . . x n ; t; P = 0) = Ω n i uγ 5d (x i , 0) y dγ 5ū (y, t) n Ω . (4)
As shown in Refs. [9,10], these correlation functions can be written in terms of products of traces of powers of the matrix
Π A =       P 1,1 P 1,2 · · · P 1,Ns P 2,1 . . . . . . P 2,Ns . . . . . . . . . . . . P Ns,1 · · · · · · P Ns,Ns       ,(5)
where N s is the number of source locations being considered, the 4N c × 4N c blocks are given by
P i,j (t) = y S u (x i , 0; y, t)γ 5 S d (y, t; , x j , 0)γ 5 ,(6)
and S u and S d are propagators for the up and down quarks, respectively. The subscript A indicates that the matrix depends on the background gauge field and Π A is a matrix of dimension N = 4N c N s -in the continuum limit, this can be taken to infinity. This can be further simplified in the isospin limit where the up and down quark propagators are the same, S u = S d , and by using the γ 5 hermiticity of the Dirac operator that implies that
γ 5 S d (y, x)γ 5 = S † d (x, y) so P i,j (t) = y S u (x i , 0; y, t)S † u (x j , 0; y, t) ,(7)
and we see that Π A is a non-negative definite Hermitian matrix, as are all its diagonal sub-blocks. In Ref. [9], it was shown that the correlation functions C j for j ≤ N arise as coefficients of the characteristic polynomial
P(α) = det(1 + α Π A ) = N j=0 c j α j(8)
of the matrix Π A . 1 Since the roots of the characteristic polynomial are given by the eigenvalues π i of Π A , it follows that
c n = N i1 =i2 =... =in=1 π i1 π i2 . . . π in .(9)
Thus
c 1 = N i=1 π i = tr[Π A ], c 2 = N i=1 N j =i=1 π i π j , . . . , c N = π 1 . . . π N = det[Π A ].
Since these eigenvalues are non-negative, we can bound these correlators by products of the single pion correlator by relaxing the restrictions on the summation above. That is,
c n ≤ N i1,i2,...,in=1 π i1 π i2 . . . π in = N i=1 π i n = [c 1 ] n .(10)
From this eigenvalue relation, valid on a fixed background gauge configuration, we can construct the field independent bound, c n − c n 1 ≤ 0, that holds for all A a µ . Measure positivity then implies that this relation holds at the level of QCD correlators. Since the large separation behaviour of c n is governed by the energy of the lowest energy eigenstates of the system,
c n ∼ exp(−E (0) n t), this im- plies that E (0) n ≥ n E (0) 1 = n m π .
That is, there are no bound states possible in these maximal isospin channels, and further, the two-body interactions in these systems are repulsive or vanishing at threshold. This second result follows from the fact that the relations derived above are valid in a finite volume where the energy eigenvalues are shifted by interactions [11,12]. Since the scattering length is proportional to the negative of the non-negative definite energy shift, it must be repulsive or vanishing. 2 The two-pion results are in accordance with expectations from chiral perturbation theory (χPT) [17,18] which predicts at next-to-leading order (NLO) that m π a (I=2)
ππ = −2πχ 1 + χ 3 log χ − L (I=2) ππ ,(11)
where χ = [m π /4πf π ] 2 , f π is the pion decay constant, and L (I=2) ππ is a particular combination of low energy constants (LECs) renormalised at scale µ = 4πf π . At tree level, this expression is universally negative, and at NLO it remains negative given the phenomenological constraints on L (I=2) ππ . However, the bounds derived above are statements directly about QCD and do not rely on a chiral expansion, and in fact provide a fundamental constraint on L (I=2) ππ (the use of single particle QCD inequalities to constrain χPT is discussed in Refs. [19,20]). The ππ scattering phase shifts can be experimentally extracted from studies of kaon decays [21][22][23] and the lifetime of pionium [24], but the direct constraints of the I = 2 channel are relatively weak. A chiral and dispersive analysis of experimental data nevertheless allows for a precise extraction [25], giving m π a (I=2) ππ = −0.0444 (10) and lattice QCD calculations [26][27][28][29][30][31][32] are in agreement. The sign implies that these results are concordant with the QCD inequalities derived here.  As a corollary, having shown that the (π + ) n systems do not bind, we can follow the discussion of Ref. [5] and strengthen the nucleon mass bound of Weingarten to m N ≥ 3 2 m π . This improves on the bounds of Refs. [1,6,33] as it applies for arbitrary N f and N c and the inequality directly involves the pion mass. Furthermore, less complete modifications of the restricted sums in Eq. (9) show also that E j for all j > n. This then implies that the I = 3, π + π + π + interaction is separately repulsive at threshold, as are the I = n, (π + ) n interactions. In principle, the form of these interactions could be computed in the chiral expansion, and the constraints derived here would bound the LECs that enter. Lattice calculations show that the π + π + π + interaction is indeed repulsive [34,35].

The inequalities above concern identical pseudoscalar mesons formed from quarks of equal mass, but can be generalised in a number of ways. In particular, these inequalities can be extended to the case of unequal quark masses; thereby analogous results can be derived multiple pion systems away from the isospin limit. Further, by defining
K i,j (t) = y S u (x i , 0; y, t)S † s (y, t; , x j , 0) ,(12)
where S s (x, y) is the strange quark propagator, in addition to P i,j , correlators containing both π + and K + mesons can be studied. The matrix K A can be constructed from the K i,j sub-blocks analogously to Eq. (5). To see how these generalisations arise, we need to examine the spectrum of the relevant matrices. If we denote the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Dirac operator as λ i and v i respectively, that is D / v i = λ i v i , we can decompose the quark propagators as
S q = i v i v * i λ i + m q ≡ i σ (q) i v i v * i ,(13)
and the matrix Π A as
Π A ≡ i π i v i v * i = i,j v i v * i λ i + m u v j v * j λ j + m d † = i v i v * i (−λ 2 i + m u m d + λ i (m u − m d )) (m 2 u − λ 2 i )(m 2 d − λ 2 i ) ,(14)
with a similar expression for K A (in the second equality for Π A , we have used completeness as we are integrating over the position of the sink in defining P i,j ). Because of the spectral properties of the Dirac operator (λ i ∈ I, and {λ i , λ * i } both eigenvalues), the eigenvalues of quark propagators, σ (q) i , fall on circles (centre (1/(2m q ), 0), radius 1/(2m q )) in the complex plane. For the matrix Π A in the isospin limit, we immediately see that the eigenvalues are real and non-negative as stated above, occupying the interval [0, 1/m q ]. Away from the isospin limit, Π A and K A have eigenvalues, denoted π i and κ i respectively, that occur in complex conjugate pairs with non-negative real parts and imaginary parts that are proportional to the mass splitting |m 1 − m 2 |. The locii of these eigenvalues are shown in Fig. 1 for exemplary masses.

The properties discussed above are enough to show that even in the less symmetric cases mentioned above, the generalisations of the eigenvalue inequality used in Eq. (10) still hold, at least for certain quark mass ratios in systems containing up to n = 8 particles (for example π + π + π + K + ) where we have explicitly checked. 3 To see this, we reconsider the eigenvalue sums that occur in the expressions for correlators 4 with the quantum numbers of (π + ) j (K + ) n−j , denoted c j,n−j . As the simplest example we consider (15) and shall show that the last sum is positive. This is most easily approached in the N → ∞ limit in which the eigenvalue sums become continuous integrals. To make our notation simpler, we replace λ → iλ R with λ R ∈ R and subsequently drop the subscript. In this case, defining  17). Also shown are relevant physical mass ratios for π + π + at m d = mu and π + K + and K + K + .
c 1,1 ∼ i j =i π i κ j = i,j π i κ j − i π i κ i ,f a,b (λ) = λ 2 + m a m b + i λ(m a − m b )) (λ 2 + m 2 a )(λ 2 + m 2 b ) ,(16)• • • π + π + π + � + � + � +
and π(λ) = f u,d (λ) and κ(λ) = f u,s (λ), we can replace
i π i κ i by ∞ −∞ Dλ π(λ) κ(λ) ,(17)
where the measure Dλ ≡ dλ ρ(λ) is weighted by the spectral density of the Dirac operator, ρ(λ). Since the spectral density is non-negative, a non-negative integrand results in a non-negative integral. However, the integrand above is only positive definite for some ranges of the ratios m d /m u and m s /m u as is shown for this case in Fig. 2. If the mass ratios are in the allowed region, then c 1,1 ≤ c 1,0 c 0,1 and through the same logic that we employed for I = 2 ππ systems, we see that E π + K + ≥ m π + + m K + , so I = 3/2 π + K + scattering can not result in bound states. This result is in agreement with lattice calculations [36][37][38][39]. Outside these parameter ranges, the integral has negative contributions at intermediate λ but is positive at large λ; given the expectations of the behaviour of the spectral density, ρ(λ) ∼ V λ 3 for large λ, this suggests that the integral is always positive in Eq, (17), but this cannot be proven rigorously. For the important cases of π + π + at m d = m u and π + K + , the physical mass ratios [40] are such that the proof is complete, but for example for I = 1 K + K + or D + D + , the mass ratios are such that the proof fails.

In a more complicated case, such as c 3,1 , the subtractions are more involved,
c 3,1 ∼ i j =i k =i,j l =i,j,k π i π j π k κ l(18)
= i,j,k,l π i π j π k κ l − 3 i j =i k =i,j (π 2 i π j κ k + π i π j π k κ i )
− i j =i (π 3 i κ j + 3π 2 i π j κ i + 3π 2 i π j κ j ) − i π 3 i κ i = i,j,k,l π i π j π k κ l − 3 i,j,k (π 2 i π j κ k + π i π j π k κ i ) − i,j (2π 3 i κ j + 6π 2 i π j κ i + 3π 2 i π j κ j ) + 6 i π 3 i κ i .
However, by again taking the continuous limit and writing the eigenvalue sums as (multiple) integrals, the term in the braces can be proven to be positive for certain values of m d /m u and m s /m u , thereby showing E π + π + π + K + ≥ 3m π + + m K + . The region of guaranteed positivity varies with the number of pions and kaons in the system, but a region exists for all c j,k . As a further generalisation, we may consider modified correlators where we replace some of the γ 5 matrices in Eq. (4) by other Dirac structures. We can then use the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality to derive the related results that the energies of arbitrary J P states with I = I z = n are bounded from below by n m π in the same manner in which Weingarten [1] showed that m X ≥ m π . This does not prohibit bound state formation if the quantum numbers prohibit an n π + state in the given channel (for example ρ + ρ + ρ + with J P = 3 − ), but limits the amount of binding that is possible.

In summary, we have shown that the hadron mass inequalities previously derived in QCD have an infinite set of analogues for multi-hadron systems that constrain the nature of the interactions between the constituent hadrons. These results provide important constraints on phenomenological, and lattice QCD studies of hadron interactions. The scope of the techniques used to derive the original hadron mass inequalities and the new techniques introduced here is more general than the two-point correlation functions considered so far, and there are a number of extensions that may be pursued productively.

There are normalisation differences between the c j and C j , and for multiple source locations, the c j are linear combinations of the C j with different numbers of interpolators at each source. The spectrum is common to each term in this linear combination.
We note that the results hold for common lattice QCD discretisations such as domain-wall[13] and overlap fermions[14,15] or Wilson fermions[16] with even numbers of flavours.
We expect that these results hold for all n and all mass ratios, but have been unable to prove the necessary relations.4 The correlators for j π + s and k K + s can be constructed from the expansion of det(1 + α(Π A + βK A ) as discussed in Ref.[36].

Quantification of anatomical and compositional features underpins both fundamental and applied studies of plant structure and function. Relatively few non-invasive techniques are available for aquatic plants. Traditional methods such as sectioning are low-throughput and provide 2-dimensional information. X-ray Computed Microtomography (µCT) offers a non-destructive method of three dimensional (3D) imaging in planta, but has not been widely used for aquatic species, due to the difficulties in sample preparation and handling. We present a novel sample handling protocol for aquatic plant material developed for µCT imaging, using duckweed plants and turions as exemplars, and compare the method against existing approaches. This technique allows for previously unseen 3D volume analysis of gaseous filled spaces, cell material, and sub-cellular features. The described embedding method, utilizing petrolatum gel for sample mounting, was shown to preserve sample quality during scanning, and to display sufficiently different X-ray attenuation to the plant material to be easily differentiated by image analysis pipelines. We present this technique as an improved method for anatomical structural analysis that provides novel cellular and developmental information.

INTRODUCTION

Anatomical phenotyping is a relatively underexplored method of phenotyping, based on high throughput quantification of anatomical features (Gomez et al., 2018;Atkinson et al., 2019). These may include vascular characteristics, organ size and shapes, and tissue arrangement. There are many methods of phenotypic and anatomic data collection (Zhao et al., 2019), that vary in time, cost, resolution, quality of information, and accessibility of technology (Table 1).

We present a protocol for the anatomical phenotyping of duckweed using X-ray Computed Microtomography (µCT) scanning. Duckweeds comprise a group of aquatic free-floating angiosperms in the family Araceae consisting of five genera: Spirodela, Landoltia, Lemna, Wolffia, and Wolfiella. Phylogenetic studies have shown that Wolffia and Wolffiella are the most derived genera, with Spirodela being the ancestral (Les et al., 2002). This evolutionary trajectory correlates to a general reduction in both size and morphological complexity, as first observed by Landolt (1986); Supplementary Figures 1A-E. All species comprise of a frond or thallus (Hillman, 1961), a leaf-like structure that in most species floats on the water's surface, with one face exposed to the air and one in contact with the water (Laird and Barks, 2018).

Members of the most ancestral genus, Spirodela, have relatively large fronds (∼10 mm diameter), and possess 7-21 roots per frond (Les and Crawford, 1999). Landoltia punctata, formerly considered part of the genus Spirodela, is morphologically similar to Spirodela, and usually has 1-7 roots per frond, but slightly smaller fronds (Les and Crawford, 1999). For Lemna, all species comprise of a single root per frond that varies in length between species (Landolt, 1980). Lemma also has significant variation in frond width (∼2-8 mm diameter), length, and thicknesses. The genera Wolffiella and Wolffia contain the smallest plants, members of both genera are rootless, and have fronds (< 3 mm diameter). One Wolffia species, Wolffia microscopica, forms a psuedo root (Sree et al., 2015). Duckweed fronds contain parenchymatic tissue containing air spaces between the upper and lower epidermal surfaces, with a large variation in the size and morphology of these air spaces between species (Landolt, 1986). Duckweed primarily reproduce asexually and are extremely fast growing, giving them a wide range of potential applications in industry and agriculture (Hillman and Culley, 1978;Yu et al., 2014;Ziegler et al., 2015). The loss of structures typical of angiosperms in duckweed may elucidate mechanisms of vestigiality and reveal how organ functionality varies between species (Laird and Barks, 2018). A feature of the life cycle in several of the duckweeds is the production of turions. These are frond-like structures, produced vegetatively by a parent frond, that are smaller and lacking roots. They are less buoyant, and sink when they become detached. This is understood to be partly as a result of high starch accumulation (Xu et al., 2018). In this state, duckweed colonies can overwinter or survive other short term stresses, such as surviving under ice in watercourses when frozen, or short term droughts (Kuehdorf et al., 2014). When suitable growth conditions return, turions then rise to the water surface, where they vegetatively produce new individual plants, complete with root and full size fronds (Appenroth, 2002).

To date, the most widely used technique for anatomical quantification of duckweed has been microscopy -either brightfield (light) microscopy or laser-scanning confocal microscopy using autofluorescence and florescent dyes. Such approaches have provided an understanding of the general structures within Lemna minor roots (e.g., Melaragno and Walsh, 1976). Techniques such as low temperature X-ray microanalysis (Echlin et al., 1982) and electron microscopy (Kim, 2007) have since been used to investigate the structural anatomy of vascular cells. Confocal images (stained with fuchsin) have been used to visualize the frond surface and identify meristematic pockets (Lemon and Posluszny, 2000). Images of paraffin embedded sections have provided resolution on internal structures allowing identification of cell types. Together these have provided a detailed understanding of the cellular structure of different organs. Although duckweed roots are similar in diameter to those of the widely studied land plant Arabidopsis, they are far less permeable to the common fluorescent dyes used in microscopy to image root anatomy, resulting in similar staining procedures showing internal structures far less clearly (Supplementary Figures 1I-K,M). It has been observed that in several aquatic plant roots, there are suberized cell layers in the outer cortex akin to a casparian strip that may act to 'waterproof ' the root to an extent, this may contribute to the observed poorer penetration of aqueous dyes (Barnabas, 1996). Because of this, it is challenging to observe at the same level of anatomical detail to which we have become accustomed to using other model plants. This problem can be alleviated to some extent by using a detergent to aid the penetration of the dye; however, image quality still falls short of images obtained in other model species. Duckweed roots also regularly contain significant amounts of chlorophyll, further complicating their imaging due to autofluorescence. Similar issues hold true for fronds. In addition to the high chlorophyll content obscuring and interfering with fluorescence, they also possess hydrophobic cuticular surfaces (Borisjuk et al., 2018) which greatly impede the penetration of most fluorescent dyes.

For these reasons, sectioning, fixing and/or clearing provide the most viable options to examine internal anatomy using microscope-based approaches. While these methods produce high quality images of roots and fronds at cellular resolution (Supplementary Figures 1H,L) there are significant drawbacks to both. Sectioning, either of live plants embedded in agarose or of fixed plants embedded in wax or plastic is destructive, and has several limitations in its capacity to capture anatomical data. Firstly, as with all microscopy there are tradeoffs between magnification, resolving power, and focal area of the objective. Secondly, the thickness of the sectioned slice, and the ability of the microscope to penetrate each slice creates an interval between images that can cause critical three dimensional (3D) information loss (Connolly, 2005). Thirdly, live plant sectioning can create a damaged surface region artifact, and finally; ex situ visualization of sections can cause a loss of anatomical and cellular context with regards to the plant as a whole.

Using chemical agents to make biological samples more transparent (tissue clearing), works well for certain duckweed species and tissues. Using this in combination with confocal microscopy with tile scanning (iterative imaging using a computer controlled stage able to auto-generate an orthomosaic) and z-step capacity, can create well resolved high resolution images up to the size of a microscope slide, at submicron intervals in the Z plane (Fouquet et al., 2015;Kurihara et al., 2015).

Depending on the working distance of the lens, the depth of the sample, and the effectiveness of any clearing and staining, it is possible to obtain complete image stacks of the whole volume of plants for the majority of species. This is an effective method of imaging cellular structures within the majority of duckweed species; however, this does not work well with the more cavernulous fronds (with many gas spaces) due to poor penetration of fixative and clearing agent, or for heavily pigmented regions. It must also be noted that structural damage  Zhao et al. (2019) can occur in samples during the vacuum infiltration steps often required for these protocols. Having to fix and clear samples also creates significant loss of information as well as being time consuming in both the sample preparation and imaging steps, thus limiting the potential for this as a high throughput method of phenotyping.

While a large amount of phenotypic data can be collected with the imaging methods listed in Supplementary Figure 1, several important questions remain unachievable. Confocal microscopy, especially for cleared plants, cannot distinguish non-fluorescent features. Extracellular spaces are prominent anatomical features in duckweed (Supplementary Figures 1F,G, es) and phenotypic variation in these spaces is likely to affect the interaction between individuals and the environment, by affecting aspects such as buoyancy. To properly assess the distribution of non-fluorescent features, the methods used must allow for analysis of volume and degree of interconnectedness of gas spaces in the frond and root.

It is for these reasons that the majority of research conducted on duckweed, has been into growth (Lasfar et al., 2007), ionomic parameters (Prasad et al., 2001;Verma and Suthar, 2015;Ziegler et al., 2016;Iqbal et al., 2019), and more recently genomic variation (Wang et al., 2014;An et al., 2019). Little consideration has been given to the effects of anatomy on these traits or vice versa. By better understanding the anatomy of duckweed, this may provide a deeper understanding of duckweed developmental and evolutionary biology, and facilitate the generation of new ideotypes for duckweed crop production. Developmentally and evolutionarily, anatomical analysis presents an opportunity to understand the development of frond structure and reproduction, and to quantify the evolutionary loss of organs and organ complexity. Quantification of environmentally important traits such as the 3D shape of fronds, spatial distribution of roots, density of fronds and turions at different developmental stages would provide basis for a more thorough understanding of how individual plants interact with their aquatic environment through future studies in fluid dynamics. From a production perspective, previous studies have largely focused on growth rates without linking them to anatomical traits (Ziegler et al., 2015) Anatomic analyses may provide novel avenues to improve production efficiency, facilitating selection of duckweed which are more productive in terms of tissue production relative to gas space, therefore yielding more biomass for the area of media occupied. Duckweeds also present a unique opportunity for linking whole-plant anatomy to production given their extremely small body plans.

Over the past few decades advances in µCT, a non-invasive method of 3D imaging, have allowed assessment into agricultural practices, notably in the quantification of structures in the soil matrix and a measurement of plant root architectural responses to environmental conditions (Tracy et al., 2012;Helliwell et al., 2013;Bacq-Labreuil et al., 2018;Rabbi et al., 2018;Schlüter et al., 2018). In more recent years, µCT has also been applied in quantifying a variety of plant anatomical and morphological traits ( Table 1, Mairhofer et al., 2017) or to finer detailing of these effects on plant leaf architecture and the structural changes incurred under different stresses in the environment (Mathers et al., 2018;Lundgren et al., 2019). The use of µCT has advanced the understanding of developmental and environmental aspects of plant anatomy including identification of 3D traits that impact mesophyll conductance (Earles et al., 2018) and insights into the evolution of leaf anatomical features in vascular plants (Théroux-Rancourt et al., 2020). In this paper we discuss the advantages of using this non-destructive technique for assessing duckweed genera. Unlike other techniques, µCT allows the scanning of live plants with no prior staining or clearing required. Crucially unlike previous methods described, µCT can distinguish material based on image greyscale level (a function of X-ray attenuation) between air filled and water filled regions. X-ray µCT allows for fast and accurate 3D image analysis, not requiring a deconvolution step as in fluorescence microscopy. The method described here increases the throughput for image acquisition compared with the conventional microscopy-based approaches albeit at slightly lower image resolutions. This study is the first to provide a procedure for assessing the anatomy of aquatic plants using µCT.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

All reagents were acquired from Sigma Aldrich (United Kingdom), Petrolatum (Vaseline R ) from Boots (Boots UK Limited), and consumable equipment purchased from Starlab (United Kingdom) unless otherwise stated. All analysis was performed using Excel 2016 (Microsoft) and Prism 8 (Graph Pad).


Plant Material and Growth Conditions

The following duckweed accessions were used in this work, provided by the Landolt Collection ETH Zurich.

Spirodela polyrhiza 9509 Spirodela intermedia 7820 Landoltia punctata 7760 Lemna minor 7123 Wolffiella lingulata 8324 Wolffia arrhiza 5684 Duckweed colonies were cultivated in sterile 250 ml conical flasks containing 150 ml of autoclaved N-media (Appenroth et al., 1996) per flask, each inoculated with 5-10 individuals transferred from sterile stock colonies using an inoculating loop, and stoppered with sterile cotton wool. Flasks were then placed in a controlled environment cabinet (Conviron Gen 1000), and grown for 14 days at 21 • C, 16-8 photoperiod, and 150 µmol m −2 s −1 photon flux density.

As duckweed morphogenesis is highly variable; the following criteria for selecting plants for imaging was applied. Individual plants had separated from their mother frond, produced root/s of greater than 3 mm in length (where applicable), had a frond of average or greater size for the population, and had no visible discoloration or deformation of the frond.


Petrolatum Embedding

To prepare samples for X-ray µCT scanning plants were embedded in a core of petrolatum inside of modified syringes (Figure 1). Two different approaches were used depending on whether embedding rooted or rootless plants (Without roots, more plants could be embedded in a smaller volume of petrolatum and imaged together, increasing throughput). The following protocol, once components have been prepared, took approximately 3-5 min to prepare a core with a rooted sample embedded, and 5-8 min to prepare a core with between three and nine rootless plants embedded. Unless specified, all steps were carried out at room temperature.


Pre-preparation (Figures 1A,B,H,I)

Different embedding methods were used depending on the size of the sample and the presence or absence of roots, however, the pre-preparation method used was the same for all sized plants; plants were removed from media using a petrolatum coated inoculating loop (to avoid physical damage to the frond), and dried of excess media by placing on blotting paper and patted lightly ( Figure 1A). Samples were then transferred to mineral oil, and shaken gently, to remove any remaining media and reduce cohesion between roots (where applicable; Figure 1B). Rooted samples were transferred to blotting paper using an inoculating loop ( Figure 1A), and rootless samples were decanted with the oil directly onto the blotting paper.


Rooted Plant Embedding (Figures 1C-G)

A total of 50 ml of Petrolatum was decanted into a 100 ml glass beaker, and placed in a 55 • C incubation oven until molten this was then stored at the same temperature until use. Syringes (3 ml Soft-Ject HSW) were prepared by raising the plunger and cutting the barrel tip off with a razor blade at the shoulder thus leaving just the uncovered open barrel cylinder. Petrolatum was then poured from the beaker into the syringe until two thirds full of molten petrolatum ( Figure 1C). Until use, filled syringes were stored at 55 • C. Pre-prepared plants, were then transferred to the molten petrolatum and agitated lightly to separate the roots and dislodge any trapped air ( Figure 1D). When the petrolatum had solidified enough to hold the frond in place (approximately 30 s), the remaining third of the syringe barrel was filled with molten petrolatum ( Figure 1E). The syringe was then placed in an iced water bath until the petrolatum core containing the embedded duckweed was fully solidified (∼3 min; Figure 1F). Once the core was solid, the plunger was depressed, expelling the core which was then trimmed using a razor blade to minimize the regions without sample included for ease of alignment when scanning ( Figure 1G). The prepared core was then be stored in the ice bath until ready for use.


Rootless Plant Embedding (Figures 1J-O)

Petrolatum was prepared as in the previous section. The tip of the syringe was removed and the barrel bisected along the vertical axis and then taped (microporous tape) along the end of the half barrel. One half of the barrel was then filled to two thirds full of molten petrolatum and allowed to solidify ( Figure 1J). Pre-prepared samples were then partially embedded by gently pressing the fronds horizontally with an inoculating loop into the soft petrolatum ( Figure 1K). This should only be done enough to secure the frond in place, while ensuring the frond is not pressed hard enough to push the frond through the petrolatum and in contact with the plastic of the syringe. The syringe was then reassembled around the plunger and fastened with micropore tape to seal the seams ( Figure 1L). The remaining volume of the syringe barrel was then filled with molten petrolatum by pouring down the unfilled side of the barrel ( Figure 1M). Once the petrolatum was partially set (Figure 1N), the syringe was cooled in an iced water bath as in Figure 1F until the petrolatum core had fully solidified. The plunger was then depressed expelling the core; this was then trimmed by hand to the region of interest ( Figure 1O). The prepared core was then stored in an ice bath until used. In the case of samples < 3 mm the same process was applied using Falcon Sterological Pipettes (1 ml) instead of the syringes, this allowed for less petrolatum interference during scanning and the ability to achieve higher scanning resolution due to smaller sample width.


X-Ray Microtomography

Each specimen was scanned on a Phoenix Nanotom 180 high resolution X-ray CT system, (Baker Hughes Digital Solutions GmbH, Wunstorf, Germany) at the Hounsfield Facility, University of Nottingham, United Kingdom. Cores extruded from syringes samples ( Figure 2B) were mounted on a 10 mm diameter rod using the petrolatum drawn from the edge of the core to hold it in place during the scan on the rotation stage ( Figure 2C). Cores prepared in the sterological pipettes were scanned directly by placing the tube within the rotation stage. The scan parameters were optimized to allow a balance between a large field of view and a high resolution (which was dependent on the genera) with the aim to also provide good contrast between petrolatum, plant material, and gas air filled pores. Each sample was imaged using a fast scan procedure with a voltage and current of 70 kV and 100 µA, respectively at a voxel size resolution of between 6-0.8 µm (depending on the genera and sample preparation size), with the specimen stage rotating through 360 degrees at a rotation step increment of 0.25 degrees over a period of 39 min, producing a total of 1,440 projection images were obtained by averaging one frames with an exposure of 1,500 ms each, at every rotation step. The authors would like to note that these settings were optimal in providing the data for high throughput analysis, longer settings can also be used should there be a requirements for better image quality by changing the scan settings to include more projections, increase image timing and increase the number of images captured (average/skip) for each projection to reduce movement in the sample during the scan examples of such setting are shown in Table 2. Each scan was then reconstructed using DatosRec software (Baker Hughes Digital Solutions GmbH, Wunstorf, Germany). Radiographs were visually assessed for sample movement before being reconstructed in 16-bit depth volumes with a beam hardening correction of 3. An inline median filter was applied to reduce noise in the image. Reconstructed volumes were then post processed in VG Studio MAX (version 2.2.0; Volume Graphics GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) see Image Processing.


Sample Stability Testing

Petrolatum embedding was compared to three alternate methods for suitability in maintaining frond stability during µCT scanning. Previously, many small plant µCT methods have used a small sealed chamber (Furuya et al., 2019;Kunishima et al., 2020) in order to reduce desiccation of the samples during scanning. This established method, along with keeping duckweed in N-media, and embedding them in N-media solidified with agarose, was tested.

To determine sample stability, fronds were imaged with a digital camera at 0, 1, and 6 h after preparation (so as to ensure stability exceeded the typical scan time of 1-2 h), with the area of each frond measured at each time point, and observations were made of changes in position and condition of frond over time.

For each treatment, two 24 well trays containing 16 individual plants were prepared according to the different methods and stored under conditions similar to those used in the CT scanner, between imaging intervals.

For plants in air (sealed chambers), plants were removed from media, dried gently on blotting paper, placed individually in wells, imaged, and then covered with laboratory film (Parafilm, Bemis) and stored in darkness until further imaging; Parafilm was removed before and reapplied after imaging.

For liquid media, 2.5 ml of N-media was pipetted into each well, and an individual frond was transferred into each well. Plants were immediately imaged, covered with Parafilm and stored in darkness until further imaging at 1 and 6 h, when Parafilm was removed before and reapplied after imaging.

For embedding in solidified media, agarose (1% w/v) was added to N-media, autoclaved, and allowed to cool to 55 • C in an incubating oven. Then 2.5 ml of this molten agarose-media was transferred to 32 wells, and individual plants were then added to each well. Wells were surrounded with ice water, then an additional layer of 0.5 ml of agarose was applied to each well to cover the plants. Trays were imaged, then stored un-covered in darkness until further imaging at 1 and 6 h.

For petrolatum embedding, plants were prepared in a similar method as described above (Figure 1). Plants were pre-prepared in the same way (Figures 1A,B), then transferred to wells filled with 2.5 ml of molten petrolatum, wells were surrounded with ice water, and a minimal amount of petrolatum ∼0.2 ml was then applied to the surface of each frond to cover them completely. Trays were imaged, then stored un-covered in darkness until further imaging at 1 and 6 h.

Frond area at each time point was measured using the magic threshold wand tool in ImageJ (Schindelin et al., 2012), and percentage change in area was calculated in excel. Observations were also made at each time interval of relative position of frond in well, and any changes in condition or appearance of fronds. The frond area at each time point was analyzed in Prism 8 using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Tukeys multiple comparison test, with an n = 32 and a p-value of 0.05. Percentage area change of fronds over time was calculated in Excel and graphed in Prism 8.


Alternate Anatomical Imaging

To allow for a comparison of the new µCT method with existing techniques, duckweeds were cleared, sectioned, and imaged using standard techniques described below.


Clearing and Whole Root Imaging

Supplementary Figure 1 shows Lemna minor roots stained in a similar method to standard Arabidopsis thaliana practices (Mellor et al., 2020), immersing the root in fluorescent dye for a short period (3 min), followed by a rinse in purified reverse osmosis (RO) water (1 min) and imaging using a confocal laser scanning microscope with settings specific to the dye used.

Plants were cleared (Supplementary Figure 1H) based on the ClearSee procedure described by Kurihara et al. (2015), modified slightly. As fluorescent markers were not being used, plants were fixed overnight in ethanol and acetic acid (3:1 v/v) rather than paraformaldehyde, as this reduced the toxicity and requirement for vacuum infiltration, which can be damaging to the air spaces. Plants were then rinsed three times in RO water and left for 30 min, then RO water was replaced with ClearSee solution (10% Xylitol, 15% Sodium Deoxycholate, 25% Urea; Kurihara et al., 2015) and left to clear for 2 weeks. Prior to imaging, plants were stained for 1 h with calcofluor in ClearSee (100 µg/ml), and then washed in ClearSee for 1 h. Imaging was carried using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP5), using a 405 nm diode laser at 12% and hybrid detector with a range of 440-450 nm, gain of 25%, and pinhole of 0.5 AU.


Sectioning

The sectioning method presented by Atkinson and Wells (2017) was adapted to better suit the specifics of duckweed anatomy. Polypropylene 15 ml conical centrifuge tubes (Fisher Scientific) were cut perpendicular to the length of the tube into 5 cm lengths of uniform cross section. Micropore tape was used to seal one end of each of the lengths of tube, which were then filled with 5 ml of molten agarose (5% w/v), and allowed to cool to 39 • C. Plants were then removed from media with an inoculating loop, dried of excess media on filter paper, and then submerged in the agarose. The number of plants that can be embedded per block is variable and depends on the number of roots per frond. For multi-rooted species (Spirodela spp., Landoltia punctata), it is the authors' recommendation to only embed one individual per tube to prevent sample coalescence. For single rooted (Lemna spp.), 3-5 plants can be embedded per tube, and for rootless plants (Wolffiella spp., Wolffia spp., turions), depending on the size of the plants, it is recommended that no more than 30 plants are embedded in a 5 ml block. Embedding multiple plants per block increases the potential throughput of this method, however, can reduce the stability of the block during sectioning.

When embedding plants for root sectioning, for blocks with multiple roots it is desirable for these to be parallel to each other so they can be sectioned in the same plane. To achieve this it was best to hold plants with forceps by the frond, submerge them fully in the agarose to the bottom of the tube, and slowly pull the fronds back toward the surface, which aligned the roots beneath the frond.

To embed fronds for sectioning, to avoid damage to the frond, plants were handled by the root, or Pasteur pipette and inoculating loop for rootless plants. Fronds were submerged in the agarose, and to prevent fronds resurfacing after embedding, they were embedded as the surface of the agarose was setting and monitored until set. To embed many rootless fronds, or turions, after drying can be done by gently stirring them into the cool molten agarose cylinder to distribute them evenly.

Blocks were trimmed by hand at the base prior to mounting to position the sample perpendicular to plane of the desired section. For sectioning a vibrating microtome (7000smz-2, Campden Instruments, Ltd.) was used, the section thickness was 150 µm, blade speed of 1 mm/s and frequency of 65 Hz. Rootless plants may require different settings as the vibration can dislodge the small fronds, thicker slices of ∼250 µm are generally more optimal to avoid sample attrition, however, this will only give a single slice through most rootless duckweed. Additionally, with moderate hand sectioning competency and a sharp blade, similar quality slices could be achieved with a lower attrition rate.

As per Atkinson and Wells (2017) recommendations, for confocal imaging of root and frond sections, sections were stained in fluorescent brightener 28 (calcofluor) solution (0.3 mg/ml) for 1 min then rinsed in RO water for 1 min before imaging on a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP5). This was done using a 405 nm diode laser at 6% and hybrid detector with a range of 440-450 nm, gain of 15%, and pinhole of 0.5 AU.

To image starch content and distribution in fronds and turions, sections were prepared as above, then stained with dilute Lugol's iodine (25% v/v) for 45 s, rinsed for 1 min in RO water, and imaged on a dissecting brightfield microscope (Zeiss).


Image Processing


3D µCT Data: VG Studio Max

Reconstructed volumes were post processed in Volume Graphics Studio MAX (version 2.2.0; Volume Graphics GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). Samples were initially assessed to determine if further filtering was required to reduce image noise. An adaptive gauss filter (smoothing = 1.2, Edge Threshold = 1, Iterations = 1, multiplier = 1) was applied to the data set to reduce the noise and help with image segmentation if this was required. Segmentation was then performed using surface determination and region growing tools. By selecting greyscale tolerances (determined by sample density and X-ray attenuation) a selection of just plant material could be achieved. This selection could then be saved as a region of interest (ROI), and then following the same procedure, be added to using the region grower tool until the whole plant was selected. The ROI smoothing function of 1 was used to reduce noise artifact before rendering as a 3D model which rotated and clipped to visualize specific regions and structures within the specimen. While largely dependent on processing power of the hardware used, the manual steps of this method took under 5 min to segment a single region of interest.


2D: ImageJ

Two-dimensional (2D) image stacks were exported in three different projections, XY, ZX, and YX from VGStudioMAX (version 2.2.0; Volume Graphics GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) from the raw CT data. Image stacks created from VGStudioMAX were exported at resolution thickness 6-0.8 µm depending upon the genera. Different traits within the duckweed were easier to visualize depending on the image plane XY (top down) was best for visualizing gas space interconnectivity and root structure. Whilst ZX (front on) or YX (side on) are best to visualize cross sections along the length of the frond such as Supplementary Figure 1F and that shown in Figure 3.

As within VGStudioMAX, the image stacks were segmented using the greyscale distributions (linked to X-ray attenuation and thus relating to the density of the material) into different categories: plant tissue, gas, petrolatum, and high density regions (thought to be starch deposits based on measurement of particle size (Pankey et al., 1965), following the procedure in Figure 3. The image stacks (referred to interchangeably with image) were loaded into FIJI; then smoothed with a Gaussian Blur (2.5 pixel sigma radius) to reduce noise (Figures 3, 1), thresholded (0-155) and processed using ImageJ binary processing tools (Invert, Fill Holes, Open, Analyze Particles (Pixel size:1000-∞, Circularity 0-1, Show Mask, Invert, Dilate, Close, Fill Holes, Erode) to create an overlay mask containing all plant material and minimal petrolatum or gas outside the plant (Figures 3A-F). This was then inverted and removed from the blurred image, leaving only the features of interest (Figures 3, 2-6).

The features of interest ( Figure 3G) were then manually thresholded, using eight-bit image stacks, to different levels to create masks for the desired categories, for example applying a threshold of 1-125 created a mask for enclosed gas spaces, 126-224 for regular plant tissue, and 225-255 for the high density tissue (believed to be the starch deposits). These values can be adjusted to suit the specific image parameters and better align with observed features as required. Full automated thresholds could be applied when processing multiple samples of a similar size. Full set up of this procedure took approximately 10 min, to adjust for variation in threshold values, then subsequent use took under a minute to run for each scan image stack.

For quick visualization of a comparable outcome to the segmentation, a custom lookup table (LUT) using similar values and colorization to those in the pipeline of Figure 3 can be applied (Supplementary Data Sheet 1).

A combined approach, utilizing the 2D segmentation procedure for 3D trait analysis was carried out using the ImageJ plugin BoneJ (Doube et al., 2010), as previously used for analysis of gas content of plant material (Lundgren et al., 2019). Particle analysis of the binary masked gas space stack (Figure 3J), outputs measurement of a range of topological features of each distinct gas space (Volume, surface area, Feret diameter, thickness, Euler number), and can generate recolored image stacks, colored according to values of particle traits (number, volume, thickness), which can subsequently be visualized in 3D using ImageJ 3D viewers or with VGStudioMax. Representative 3D renderings of pore number ( Figure 6A) and pore size ( Figure 6B) as well pore thickness (Figure 7) illustrated by heat map, were constructed in VG StudioMAX (version 2.2.0; Volume Graphics GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) using Phong rendering tools. Heat map data of the 'Thickness' of pores was produced as a function within ImageJ plugin BoneJ which also provided a mean and maximum channel diameter from the image stack. After binarization of the image stacks (Figures 3K-M), use of this plugin was fully automated. Image processing takes from a few minutes to several hours depending on the scan and processing power of the machine used, with the larger the plant and more numerous and interconnected the gas spaces generally the longer the process. Following the 3D particle analysis of internal gas spaces, results were processed in Prism 8. To confirm presence of gas within fronds and roots, pixel value measurements were taken of air inclusions in the petrolatum core, and of gas spaces within frond and root at 50 points within each area using the point tool in FIJI. These measurements were analyzed in Excel with a Student's t-test.


Turion Composition Analysis

All sunken turions were collected from a colony of S. polyrhiza 9509, 2 weeks after inoculation. Of the turions at the bottom of the flask, half were transferred to 50 ml fresh media in a 50 ml falcon tube and stored at 4 • C in constant darkness for 8 weeks. The remaining half were transferred to fresh media in a new flask under standard described growth conditions for the same time period. From the new flask, three turions that were floating at the surface of the media, and three that remained sunken at the bottom of the flask were collected. Additionally, three turions from the cold treated set that were not floating were also collected.

All plants were prepared following the rootless plant protocol and scanned using the fast scan µCT settings described. Image stacks were then processed using the described 2D pipeline in ImageJ. Post segmentation, analysis was carried out to determine the percentage composition of each turion based on the three categories of plant tissue, gas, and high density tissue. Total area of each group of was measured for each image stack in FIJI. Based on the known high accumulation of starch in Spirodela turions, the size of starch granules in turions, (Xu et al., 2011), the high density of starch, and comparison with iodine stained turions, the high density regions on the scans are likely to be starch deposits. However, other structures have been identified in duckweed fronds that may cause a similarly increased level of X-ray attenuation, such as calcium oxalate or tannin deposits (Mazen et al., 2004;Xu et al., 2018). While iodine staining for a greater duration of time shows that there is starch present throughout the turion, measuring these larger presupposed starch deposits may be a useful proxy for total starch content. To determine turion composition, following measurement of image stacks (Figures 3H-J) in FIJI, total area of each measured component of turions was calculated in Excel, and percentage composition was calculated and graphed in Prism 8, statistical analysis was not performed due to small sample size. 


RESULTS

One species from each duckweed genus was prepared, scanned, and processed using the described methods (Figure 4). Representative scans were rendered into 3D to gauge the efficiency of the preparation and scanning method; showing that across the full range of sizes within the Lemnoideae this method produces high quality images at a relatively fast throughput.


Method Evaluation


Comparison of Embedding Methods

Of the four preparation methods tested, only petrolatum embedding produced consistent usable results. When scanning was performed in either growth media or air, the frond or roots were able to move, and in agarose solidified N-media the plants became deformed, and decreased in area, presumably due to loss of turgor within the core (Figure 5A). These observations were also confirmed in the µCT image data; in addition to a poor contrast between the agarose solidified media and the plant, there appeared to be respiration of the plant, creating a gas pocket around the frond, and significant shrinkage/movement of the frond within resulting in poor or unworkable data. A significant reduction (p < 0.0001) in frond area of 24% was observed after 1 h and significant reduction (p < 0.0001) of 60.6% after 6 h when plants were maintained in air ( Figure 5B). In liquid media, after 6 h there was a small non-significant increase in frond area with a high degree of frond movement between images. In solidified agar media, there was a small non-significant increase in area after 1 h, and a larger non-significant overall decrease in area after 6 h. When using petrolatum, there was no significant change in frond area at each timepoint.

When exposed to air, fronds dried and shrunk. Despite covering the trays, water still evaporated from the media over the course of the experiment, causing a reduction in well level which caused sample movement and a reduction in the apparent area of frond in the image as the sample moved out of focus. Coupled with the high growth rate of duckweed, this caused variation in appearance of frond size. Similarly to liquid media, the plants in solidified media grew, while the solidified media core shrunk due to evaporation. While this may be mitigated by covering the solidified media core, or embedding within a sealed container, this would increase the diameter of the core and limit the achievable resolution of the scan. Though the mean percentage change in frond area is small for plants on liquid or agarose solidified media, the highly variable results make these methods unsuitable for sample preparation, compared to the highly consistent petrolatum results. In addition to preventing the sample moving, and maintaining area and shape of the sample (Table 3), petrolatum coating maintains the water content of the samples (Korte and Porembski, 2011) and can be stored for several days with no noticeable deterioration of anatomical features. 


Image Processing Methods

The different image processing methods presented provide a range of options for visualization and analysis depending on the desired information. To visualize the internal structures, segmenting and rendering the plant using the 3D method gives the most flexibility and perspective as one is able to view the plant as a whole (Figures 4C,I) or clip into the render revealing internal structures (Figures 4A,D,F,G,H,J). This can be done aligned to the three projection planes (XY, ZX, ZY), or unaligned, presenting different perspectives to those possible with 2D alone. The plant can also be rotated and clipped to multiple planes to reveal or isolate particular features in the 3D object view (Figures 4G,J). Though very rich in information and capable of enabling measurements of internal structures, this method is the most time consuming in segmentation, costly in processing power, and limited in the rate of measurements possible without additional computational measurement add-on packages to the software. The 2D freeware analysis pipeline presented provides a higher throughput analysis method that is largely automatable and has a much lower requirement of processing power. It is well suited for analysis of plant composition (tissue/gas), and rapid measurement of segmented features. If properly embedded, specific measurements can be manually taken such as organ length, width, and thickness. Of the scans taken, segmentation of the micrographs agrees with visual assessment of ROIs with a high degree of accuracy. To observe specific traits such as gas space interconnectivity, distribution of nerves, and root anatomy, it is easier to do so by parsing through 2D stacks than clipping through the 3D model as the 2D images are of a single plane (depending on the data set size), and can be done without the need for segmentation.

The method of 3D trait analysis of gas spaces using the 2D segmentation worked well for analysis of the representative scans of S. intermedia, L. punctata, L. minor, and W. lingulata included in Figure 4, however, the process ran poorly on the W. arrhiza and S. polyrhiza turions due to the resolution of the scan and the small size of the gas spaces. Using the 3D particle analysis tools in the plugin BoneJ (ImageJ), all internal gas spaces in the frond were measured, providing gas space volume, surface area, thickness, diameter, and Euler number (connectivity), as shown in Table 4. Analyzing this data from the S. intermedia scan, the volume distribution of gas spaces can be determined ( Figure 6C) and thus statistical analysis can be performed on the uniformity of the frequency both at an intra and inter species level when applied to large experimental programs. The recolored image stack outputs from BoneJ allow for visualization of the number of individual gas spaces in 3D (Figure 6A), and the distribution of differently sized gas spaces throughout this frond. The volume differences between gas spaces shown by the graduated color mapped image (Figure 6B), and the thickness of each gas space shown by the heat mapped image (Figure 7), show that in this individual, larger and thicker gas spaces are located in the middle of the frond, while smaller and thinner gas spaces are found at the surfaces of the frond. This type of quantification will allow for much better understanding and phenotyping of duckweed species when applied to a whole replicated experimental program.

Following conversion of the image stack to 8-bit, the custom LUT (Supplementary Data Sheet 1) provides an option for rapid visualization of an approximate segmentation of the 2D image stacks but does not enable accurate automated measurement. This requires minimal processing power, and still allows manual measurements to be taken.


Compositional Determination

In addition to enabling the acquisition of three-dimensional anatomical data, µCT scanning can also support other methods of anatomical phenotyping. Sections of S. intermedia roots (Figure 8B), showed large extracellular voids. Though these were identifiable as aerenchyma based on understanding of root anatomy (Jung et al., 2008), confirming that these are in fact interconnected gas filled channels, was not possible with sectioning alone. Measurement of the image pixel values for the air bubble inclusions within the petrolatum, and the values observed inside the root channels and frond are similar enough that we can say with confidence (p = 0.0154) that the extracellular spaces in the root are gaseous in the samples we observed. This agrees with the segmentation method described in Figure 3, as shown in Figure 8C. Using this information, the extracellular spaces in Figure 8B, can be labeled and recolored as air spaces ( Figure 8D).

Further to the confirmation of gas spaces, µCT can be used as a method to evaluate differences in material composition. The imaging and analysis pipeline was shown to be effective in evaluating differences between collection variants of duckweed turions. Figures 9A-C show three representative images from the middle slice of XZ image stack of sunken, floating, and coldtreated turions; whilst Figures 9D-F shows the segmentation of these slices using the 2D segmentation method described in Figure 3. Quantification of turion composition shows a differing range of percentage composition of tissue, gas, and starch between collection variants. Although significance testing was not possible due to the small sample size, the scans showed a lower proportion of tissue and a higher proportion of gas in the floating turions than the sunken or cold treated turions ( Figure 9I).


DISCUSSION

Of the methods investigated for anatomical phenotyping of duckweed, the only technique that allowed live whole plant imaging with the capability to visualize internal anatomical features was µCT scanning. To enable µCT imaging of duckweed, samples must be prepared in a way that meets the criteria outlined within this manuscript (maintain turgor, limit unwanted movement, and have sufficient contrast). The method of plant preparation tested that met all of these needs was embedding in petrolatum. Other workable techniques may exist; but the method presented here is quick, inexpensive, and easy to use, and produces high quality results.

To optimize the image acquisition during µCT scanning, it was best to position the sample as close to the x-ray tube as possible, as this increased the resolution of the scan allowing for better observation of anatomical features. The size syringe used to prepare the petrolatum core can be changed depending on the size of the sample. For the majority of duckweed lines, a 3 ml syringe (10 mm diameter) is well suited, smaller sizes may be used, but the viscosity of the molten petrolatum may make liquid handling more difficult. For plants that are too large or small, there are alternatives to embedding the whole plant in a cylindrical core of petrolatum. For small rootless plants, similar to Figure 1K, plants can be pressed gently into a narrower half pipe filled with petrolatum, rather than filling in and extruding a core, and then wholly dipped or coated in petrolatum. This gives narrower diameter profile, allowing a sample to be closer to the X-ray source and increasing geometric magnification of the scan. For larger aquatic plants, such as Pistia stratiotes, roots may be embedded in a larger syringe (10 ml) as in Figure 1D, then the leaves can be dipped in molten petrolatum to coat the surfaces. Cores prepared following the steps in Figure 1 are unlikely to have any parts of the plant exposed after the core is extruded, however, if they do, dipping in molten petrolatum will seal any remaining uncovered regions. If not intending to examine root anatomy, roots may be removed from rooted genera, and plants treated as rootless for the described protocols, increasing throughput.

The advantage of taking care to remove media from, and reduce cohesion between the roots when embedding plants in molten petrolatum (as opposed to simply sandwiching plants in, or coating plants with petrolatum) is that it allows the roots to spread and position themselves relative to the frond as they would in media. This makes it easier to segment and measure individual roots, as well as to accurately visualize the morphology of the plant as a whole, in a way more similar to how it would appear 'in aqua. ' Other phenotyping methods may be better suited to the measurement of specific traits, given the limited availability and potential high cost associated with µCT. Much of the phenotypic data gathered from a µCT scan, can also be collected with other methods, albeit in a much slower and time consuming manner. 3D geometry of the plant can be obtained without the use of tomography scanning, especially easily due to the simplified body plan of the majority of species, and internal anatomical data can be collected through sectioning and microscopy. Clearing and mounting whole plants can give gross anatomical and cellular data in tandem, with either confocal microscopy or lightsheet scanning. Where higher resolution may be required, various techniques utilizing electron microscopy may be used (Melaragno and Walsh, 1976). Of the methods investigated, identification and quantification of all the gaseous spaces and tissue within the plant is only currently possible with µCT scanning, and the richness of the data coupled with the high throughput imaging and analysis methods presented make this the best method for structural anatomical phenotyping of duckweed of the methods investigated. As shown in Figure 8, to gain anatomical insight on a structural and cellular level is through a combination of µCT scanning and confocal microscopy.

Of the image processing and analysis methods, a combined approach of 2D and 3D visualization, segmentation and analysis tools was most effective. The most dynamic and illustrative visualization possible was in using the designated 3D software, though manual measurements were easiest to obtain from 2D image stacks (although there are software upgrade packages within VGStudioMAX which can provide 3D image measurements). For segmentation, there were a variety of tools in the 3D software package that enabled the most accurate segmentation of anatomical features, however, this can be time consuming and required a high degree of skill. The 2D method was also highly accurate but took less time, is amenable to automation, and can be optimized to specific scans and sample sizes with simple adjustments. For post-segmentation analysis, all measurements presented of 2D and 3D features used ImageJ, though it would have been possible to do this using add-on packages for the 3D software. At any point in the 2D processing, the image stacks could be loaded back into the 3D software for visualization or to use the different tools available. While not presented here due to limitations of the resolution of scans available, longer scans at a higher resolution may allow measurement of pore size and interconnectivity of the smaller gas spaces present in W. arriza and S. polyrhiza turions.

Results from turion composition analysis suggest that the mechanism by which position in the water column may be moderated is through variation in anatomical structure and composition. The analysis of air spaces was comparable to previous analyses that have estimated the cellular volume taken up by aerenchyma air spaces in turions in S. polyrhiza at between 9-15% using a combination of sectioning and TEM (Kim, 2013). The presented methodology confers several advantages. Firstly, µCT allows the full 3D turion to be investigated and so composition does not need to be inferred from a few slices. Secondly, as this technique is non-destructive, it could be applied to the same turion at multiple stages during dormancy to observe changes over time. Further work is needed to test whether the increased volume of gas filled space within the turion is causal for its rise from the bottom of the water body. Here, we show that using the provided methods it is possible to find variation in anatomical structures. Identification and quantification of different tissue composition is feasible based on visual comparison of the size and distribution of the high contrast regions seen within turions in the CT scans, and sections of iodine-stained turions. The high concentration of these regions in turions compared to other lines and tissues suggests these may be starch deposits (though there may be other materials present in different tissues and species that cause a similar level of X-ray attenuation and further work is required to confirm composition). Previous analysis of turions through sectioning have reported the presence of starch granules (Appenroth et al., 2011). Through isolation of these starch grains, SEM has been used to show that these start to reduce in size under exposure to high light, as starch is broken down into lower molecular weight carbohydrates (Appenroth et al., 2011). It will be interesting to see how this breakdown of starch is associated with the small differences in air spaces that we observed in the buoyant versus submerged turions. Out of all the methods discussed, µCT scanning provides the best way of obtaining 3D structural information, as duckweed turions are heavily pigmented and do not clear well, whilst their small size makes them difficult to section using high throughput approaches.

A further application of this method could be to investigate the importance of frond composition from an industrial perspective. Globally, duckweed is becoming a more common food and feed product. For producers, understanding relative anatomical composition of fronds may enable selection of more productive duckweed varieties. 3D analysis of plant morphology would also aid in our understanding of how different duckweeds are adapted to their relative ecological niches and how anatomy affects interaction with their highly dynamic aquatic environment.

In summary, we present a protocol for the preparation and µCT scanning of duckweed (and other potential aquatic species) at reasonably high throughput that produces high-resolution 3D anatomical and compositional information of live specimens.

EDITORIAL COMMENT

The Time Is Now to Investigate Ventilator Settings in Acute Cardiovascular Patients* 2,226 patients, the authors found that >85% were exposed to low intrapulmonary pressures (LPPVs) at 24 hours (used as a surrogate for LPV) and that LPPV was associated with a higher survival to discharge compared with patients exposed to higher airway pressures (47.4% vs 32.6%; P < 0.001). There were key differences between groups, including appropriate. For more information, visit the Author Center.

It is important to emphasize the limitations of the data used in these analyses, 5  Ventilator Settings for Acute Cardiovascular Disease The key limitations of this study are well described in the paper, and the most important aspect of this study is that it highlights the need to better understand how to optimize the management of respiratory failure in critically ill cardiac patients. The time is now to investigate ventilator settings in acute cardiovascular patients.

P. Elliott Miller, MD, MHS, a Darryl Abrams, MD b Poisons and medicine are oftentimes the same substance given with different intents. -Peter Mere Latham 1 P ositive pressure ventilation (PPV), through either noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, is implemented in >80% of patients presenting with cardiogenic shock. 2 Although frequently lifesaving and with potentially beneficial hemodynamic effects for patients with left ventricular dysfunction, PPV can also cause ventilatorinduced lung injury, the mechanisms of which include barotrauma, volutrauma, atelectrauma, and biotrauma. 3 Adherence to lung-protective ventilation (LPV) strategies (eg, plateau airway pressures #30 cm H 2 O and tidal volumes of 4-8 mL/kg predicted body weight), may help mitigate some of these potential complications. 4 Although LPV has become standard of care in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), data supporting the application of such a strategy in patients without ARDS, such as those with cardiogenic shock, are limited. In this issue of JACC: Heart Failure, Rali et al 5 report the association between ventilator settings and in-hospital mortality from the ELSO (Extracorporeal Life Support Organization) Registry in patients receiving venoarterial extracorporeal life support (VA-ECLS) for cardiogenic shock.

lower body mass index (28.3 vs 31.1 kg/m 2 ), SAVE (Survival After Veno-arterial ECMO) scores (-1.76 vs -2.77), arterial PO 2 (150 vs 186 mm Hg), and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (8 vs 10 cm H 2 O) (P < 0.001 for all) in the LPPV group. After multivariable analyses adjusting for the SAVE score, chronic lung conditions, and ECMO center volume, LPPV at 24 hours continued to be associated with improved survival. Notably, the authors defined LPPV as peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) <30 cm H 2 O measured at a single time point based on the data available in the ELSO Registry, an important limitation noted by the authors. In addition to PIP, the authors also reported associations between PEEP and dynamic driving pressure (defined as the difference between PIP and PEEP) at 24 hours and survival. After multivariable adjustment, dynamic driving pressure, but not PEEP, remained associated with in-hospital survival. Overall, Rali et al 5 should be congratulated for their work, which is an important first step in studying the potential impact of ventilator settings in this population, especially considering that those undergoing ECLS may be less dependent on invasive mechanical ventilation for gas exchange. Given that the impact of mechanical ventilation on acute cardiovascular disease is not always at the forefront of cardiologists' minds, we are also happy to see ISSN 2213-1779/$36.00 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchf.2023.04.005 *Editorials published in JACC: Heart Failure reflect the views of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of JACC: Heart Failure or the American College of Cardiology.

lower PIPs and improved survival in patients with cardiogenic shock undergoing VA-ECLS.


potential for ventilator parameters to have a significant impact on clinically meaningful outcomes, we believe there is a need for prospective clinical trials of mechanical ventilation strategies in patients with cardiogenic shock requiring VA-ECLS. Whereas repeating landmark ARDS trials in this patient population, such as comparing tidal volumes of 6 mL/kg vs 12 mL/kg predicted body weight, is both unnecessary and infeasible for lack of equipoise, comparing specific LPV strategies (eg, low tidal volume ventilation with particular plateaus Miller and Abrams J A C C : H E A R T F A I L U R E V O L . -, NO. -, 2023namely the use of 

a measurement at a single point in time (which 

may not be reflective of ventilator parameters 

throughout the duration of invasive mechanical 

ventilation) and a lack of true LPV measurements. 

Not only do we lack data on tidal volumes, but one 

must consider that PIP incorporates both lung 

compliance and airways resistance, is directly 

affected by adjustments in inspiratory flow rates, 

and can likewise be affected by patients' sponta-

neous breathing efforts, all of which mean that such 

measurements may not necessarily be reflective of 

low static airway pressures (which are believed to 

correlate best with risk of ventilator-induced lung 

injury). Even if we assume that low PIP correlates 

with low plateau airway pressures and low static 

driving pressure, it is impossible to tease out 

whether these parameters represent differences in 

how ventilator settings were applied (eg, inten-

tionally setting the ventilator to lower tidal volumes 

and airway pressures with a goal of applying more 

lung protective ventilation) or whether these pres-

sures simply reflect baseline differences in respira-

tory system compliance between the low and high 

LPPV groups, with higher compliance reflecting a 

lower severity of illness, in turn portending a better 

prognosis. One argument for such residual unmea-

sured confounders likely having a greater impact on 

outcomes than the observed ventilator parameters 

is the substantial difference in survival between 

groups, despite only a modest difference in PIP 

(2 cm H 2 O) between survivors and nonsurvivors. 

In light of these caveats and limitations, what 

should clinicians do with these data? Perhaps the 

most important takeaway is that, whether these 

ventilator parameters were intentionally targeted or a 

consequence of underlying respiratory mechanics, 

there was an observed correlation between airway 

pressures and outcomes in patients with cardiogenic 

shock. This should hopefully serve as a reminder that 

close attention must be paid to invasive mechanical 

ventilation in these patients, which is prescribed and 

requires continual adjustments, just as with medica-

tions. Expertise in mechanical ventilation should be 

within the skillset of all providers caring for patients 

in the cardiac and cardiothoracic intensive care units. 

Invasive mechanical ventilation is often lifesaving 

through provision of gas exchange support and 

airway protection; however, it also has the potential 

to cause considerable harm. Whether and to what 

degree it causes enough ventilator-induced lung 

injury to influence outcomes in patients with cardio-

genic shock requiring VA-ECLS remains unclear. In 

general, the application of LPV strategies for critically 

ill, mechanically ventilated patients, beyond those 

with established ARDS, has the potential to provide 

benefit; it remains to be seen, however, whether all 

patients should receive this strategy, or whether the 

trade-offs of deeper sedation or neuromuscular 

blockade sometimes needed to achieve LPV targets, 

or the hypercapnia induced by lower minute venti-

lation, are offset by enough of a benefit. In patients 

with cardiogenic shock supported with VA-ECLS, LPV 

targets may be more easily accomplished due to the 

presence of extracorporeal gas exchange, with the 

caveat that ECLS might not necessarily affect upper 

body gas exchange, particularly during femoral VA-

ECLS with the establishment of dual circulations. 

For those patients with cardiogenic shock in whom 

the potential benefits of LPV seem to outweigh the 

risks, we suggest targeting the previously mentioned 

LPV parameters (eg, plateau pressure #30 cm H 2 O, 

tidal volume 4-8 mL/kg), when feasible, rather than a 

particular PIP, as was investigated in the study by Rali 

et al. 5 

Where do we go from here? We would suggest 

that now is the time to incorporate invasive me-

chanical ventilation timing, settings, and measure-

ments into cardiac registries and clinical trials. By 

and large, acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock 

clinical trials have either excluded patients with 

concomitant respiratory failure or not recorded or 

reported key variables among those who developed 

respiratory failure. 2,6 Given the variability in venti-

lator management among centers providing ECLS 

support for patients with cardiogenic shock, and the
