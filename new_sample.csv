38966385,"High-efficiency color-tunable ultralong room-temperature phosphorescence from organic-inorganic metal halides via synergistic inter/intramolecular interactions.Materials exhibiting highly efficient, ultralong and multicolor-tunable room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are of practical importance for emerging applications. However, these are still very scarce and remain a formidable challenge. Herein, using precise structure design, several novel organic-inorganic metal-halide hybrids with efficient and ultralong RTP have been developed based on an identical organic cation (A). The original organic salt (ACl) exhibits red RTP properties with low phosphorescence efficiency. However, after embedding metals into the organic salt, the changed crystal structure endows the resultant metal-halide hybrids with excellent RTP properties. In particular, A(2)ZnCl(4).H(2)O exhibits the highest RTP efficiency of up to 56.56% with a long lifetime of up to 159 ms. It is found that multiple inter/intramolecular interactions and the strong heavy-atom effect of the rigid metal-halide hybrids can suppress molecular motion and promote the ISC process, resulting in highly stable and localized triplet excitons followed by highly efficient RTP. More crucially, multicolor-tunable fluorescence and RTP achieved by tuning the metal and halogen endow these materials with wide application prospects in the fields of multilevel information encryption and dynamic optical data storage. The findings promote the development of phosphorescent metal-halide hybrids for potential high-tech applications."
30668208,"Changes in premenstrual symptoms in women starting or discontinuing use of oral contraceptives.It is not clear whether oral contraceptive (OC) treatment affects premenstrual symptoms in women. The aim of the present study was to evaluate changes in premenstrual symptoms (PMS) in women starting to use or discontinuing the use of OCs. Twenty-four healthy women with no previous diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder were included in this study with a prospective crossover design. Nineteen women completed daily ratings of somatic and mood symptoms during two hormonally different cycles, during a normal menstrual cycle and while using OCs. The menstrual cycle phases were hormonally verified and the low-dose, monophasic OCs were used in a 21/7 regimen. The onset of OC use significantly decreased premenstrual somatic symptoms, but it did not affect mood symptoms. In the women who discontinued OC use, no significant changes in neither somatic nor mood symptoms appeared in the premenstrual phase."
35872794,"An Intratumor Heterogeneity-Related Signature for Predicting Prognosis, Immune Landscape, and Chemotherapy Response in Colon Adenocarcinoma.BACKGROUND: Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is a frequent malignancy of the digestive system with a poor prognosis and high mortality rate worldwide. Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) is associated with tumor progression, poor prognosis, immunosuppression, and therapy resistance. However, the relationship between ITH and prognosis, the immune microenvironment, and the chemotherapy response in COAD patients remains unknown, and this knowledge is urgently needed. METHODS: We obtained clinical information and gene expression data for COAD patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The DEPTH2 algorithm was utilized to evaluate the ITH score. X-tile software was used to determine the optimal cutoff value of the ITH score. The COAD patients were divided into high- and low-ITH groups based on the cutoff value. We analyzed prognosis, tumor mutation burden (TMB), gene mutations, and immune checkpoint expression between the high- and low-ITH groups. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the high- and low-ITH groups were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. We performed univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analyses to screen the prognosis-related genes for the construction of an ITH-related prognostic signature. The nomogram was used to predict the overall survival (OS) of COAD patients. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by using the GeneMANIA database. Principal component analysis (PCA) and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) were employed to explore the differences in biological pathway activation status between the high- and low-risk groups. The proportion and type of tumor-infiltrating immune cells were evaluated by the CIBERSORT and ESTIMATE algorithms. Additionally, we assessed the chemotherapy response and predicted small-molecule drugs for treatment. Finally, the expression of the prognosis-related genes was validated by using the UALCAN database and Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. RESULTS: The OS of the high-ITH group was worse than that of the low-ITH group. A positive correlation between ITH and TMB was identified. In subgroups stratified by age, gender, and tumor stage, the OS of the low-ITH group remained better than that of the high-ITH group. There were dramatic differences in the mutated genes, single nucleotide variant classes, variant types, immune checkpoints and cooccurring and mutually exclusive mutations of the DEGs between the high- and low-ITH groups. Based on the DEGs between the high- and low-ITH groups, we constructed a five-gene signature consisting of CEACAM5, ENO2, GABBR1, MC1R, and SLC44A4. The COAD patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups according to the median risk score. The OS of the high-risk group was worse than that of the low-risk group. The nomogram was used to accurately predict the 1-, 3- and 5-year OS of COAD patients and showed good calibration and moderate discrimination ability. The stromal score, immune score, and ESTIMATE score of the high-risk group were significantly higher than those of the low-risk group, whereas tumor purity showed the opposite trend. The patients classified by the risk score had distinguishable sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. Finally, two public databases confirmed that CEACAM5 and SLC44A4 were upregulated in normal tissues compared with COAD tissues, and ENO2, GABBR1, and MC1R were upregulated in COAD tissues compared with normal tissues. CONCLUSION: Overall, we identified an ITH-related prognostic signature for COAD that was closely related to the tumor microenvironment and chemotherapy response. This signature may help clinicians make more personalized and precise treatment decisions for COAD patients."
33091297,"Evaluation of the Pharmacophoric Role of the O-O Bond in Synthetic Antileishmanial Compounds: Comparison between 1,2-Dioxanes and Tetrahydropyrans.Leishmaniases are neglected diseases that can be treated with a limited drug arsenal; the development of new molecules is therefore a priority. Recent evidence indicates that endoperoxides, including artemisinin and its derivatives, possess antileishmanial activity. Here, 1,2-dioxanes were synthesized with their corresponding tetrahydropyrans lacking the peroxide bridge, to ascertain if this group is a key pharmacophoric requirement for the antileishmanial bioactivity. Newly synthesized compounds were examined in vitro, and their mechanism of action was preliminarily investigated. Three endoperoxides and their corresponding tetrahydropyrans effectively inhibited the growth of Leishmania donovani promastigotes and amastigotes, and iron did not play a significant role in their activation. Further, reactive oxygen species were produced in both endoperoxide- and tetrahydropyran-treated promastigotes. In conclusion, the peroxide group proved not to be crucial for the antileishmanial bioactivity of endoperoxides, under the tested conditions. Our findings reveal the potential of both 1,2-dioxanes and tetrahydropyrans as lead compounds for novel therapies against Leishmania."
34863912,"Digital Technology Application for Improved Responses to Health Care Challenges: Lessons Learned From COVID-19.While COVID-19 is still ongoing and associated with more than 5 million deaths, the scope and speed of advances over the past year in terms of scientific discovery, data dissemination, and technology have been staggering. It is not a matter of ""if"" but ""when"" we will face the next pandemic, and how we leverage technology and data management effectively to create flexible ecosystems that facilitate collaboration, equitable care, and innovation will determine its severity and scale. The aim of this review is to address emerging challenges that came to light during the pandemic in health care and innovations that enabled us to adapt and continue to care for patients. The pandemic highlighted the need for seismic shifts in care paradigms and technology with considerations related to the digital divide and health literacy for digital health interventions to reach full potential and improve health outcomes. We discuss advances in telemedicine, remote patient monitoring, and emerging wearable technologies. Despite the promise of digital health, we emphasise the importance of addressing its limitations, including interpretation challenges, accuracy of findings, and artificial intelligence-driven algorithms. We summarise the most recent recommendation of the Virtual Care Task Force to scaling virtual medical services in Canada. Finally, we propose a model for optimal implementation of health digital innovations with 5 tenets including data management, data security, digital biomarkers, useful artificial intelligence, and clinical integration."
30087619,"Toward Morphologically Relevant Extracellular Matrix in Vitro Models: 3D Fiber Reinforced Hydrogels.The extracellular matrix (ECM) is known to play an important role in the health of cells and tissues. Not only are chemical signals transmitted via bonds and tightly controlled diffusion, but the structure of the ECM also provides important physical signaling for the cells attached to it. The structure is composed of a mesh of fibrous proteins, such as collagen, embedded in a hydrated gel matrix of glycosaminoglycans. To study cell behavior with respect to the combined morphology and mechanics of such matrices is not currently possible with the types of 3D cell culture matrices available. Most of the cell culture matrices are single-phase bio- or polymeric hydrogels. Therefore, here we developed a continuous hybrid manufacturing process to make fiber-reinforced composite hydrogels. A far field electrospinning process was used to deposit the fibrous component with the aid of guiding electrodes; and a gravity-assisted, droplet-based system controlled the rate of addition of the cell-laden hydrogel component. The addition of the fibrous component slightly increased the elastic modulus of the pure hydrogel. The cells that were embedded into the fiber-reinforced hydrogels were viable for 8 days. The cells were randomly placed in the matrix such that some had no contact to the fibers and others were initially in proximity to fibers. The cells with no contact to fibers grew into spheroidal clusters within the hydrogel, and those in proximity to the fibers spread out and grew along the fibers showing that the fiber-reinforced hydrogels are able to control cell behavior with morphological cues."
39633424,"Quantitative physiology and biomass composition of Cyberlindnera jadinii in ethanol-grown cultures.BACKGROUND: Elimination of greenhouse gas emissions in industrial biotechnology requires replacement of carbohydrates by alternative carbon substrates, produced from CO(2) and waste streams. Ethanol is already industrially produced from agricultural residues and waste gas and is miscible with water, self-sterilizing and energy-dense. The yeast C. jadinii can grow on ethanol and has a history in the production of single-cell protein (SCP) for feed and food applications. To address a knowledge gap in quantitative physiology of C. jadinii during growth on ethanol, this study investigates growth kinetics, growth energetics, nutritional requirements, and biomass composition of C. jadinii strains in batch, chemostat and fed-batch cultures. RESULTS: In aerobic, ethanol-limited chemostat cultures, C. jadinii CBS 621 exhibited a maximum biomass yield on ethanol ( YX/Smax ) of 0.83 g(biomass) (g(ethanol))(-1) and an estimated maintenance requirement for ATP (m(ATP)) of 2.7 mmol(ATP) (g(biomass))(-1) h(-1). Even at specific growth rates below 0.05 h(-1), a stable protein content of approximately 0.54 g(protein) (g(biomass))(-1) was observed. At low specific growth rates, up to 17% of the proteome consisted of alcohol dehydrogenase proteins, followed by aldehyde dehydrogenases and acetyl-CoA synthetase. Of 13 C. jadinii strains evaluated, 11 displayed fast growth on ethanol (mu(max) > 0.4 h(-1)) in mineral medium without vitamins, and CBS 621 was found to be a thiamine auxotroph. The prototrophic strain C. jadinii CBS 5947 was grown on an inorganic salts medium in fed-batch cultures (10-L scale) fed with pure ethanol. Biomass concentrations in these cultures increased up to 100 g(biomass) (kg(broth))(-1), with a biomass yield of 0.65 g(biomass) (g(ethanol))(-1). Model-based simulation, based on quantitative parameters determined in chemostat cultures, adequately predicted biomass production. A different protein content of chemostat- and fed-batch-grown biomass (54 and 42%, respectively) may reflect the more dynamic conditions in fed-batch cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of ethanol-grown batch, chemostat and fed-batch cultures provided a quantitative physiology baseline for fundamental and applied research on C. jadinii. Its high maximum growth rate, high energetic efficiency of ethanol dissimilation, simple nutritional requirements and high protein content, make C. jadinii a highly interesting platform for production of SCP and other products from ethanol."
26196617,"QCD inequalities for hadron interactions.We derive generalizations of the Weingarten-Witten QCD mass inequalities for particular multihadron systems. For systems of any number of identical pseudoscalar mesons of maximal isospin, these inequalities prove that near threshold interactions between the constituent mesons must be repulsive and that no bound states can form in these channels. Similar constraints in less symmetric systems are also extracted. These results are compatible with experimental results (where known) and recent lattice QCD calculations, and also lead to a more stringent bound on the nucleon mass than previously derived, m_N>/=3/2m_pi."
33488660,"Preparation, Scanning and Analysis of Duckweed Using X-Ray Computed Microtomography.Quantification of anatomical and compositional features underpins both fundamental and applied studies of plant structure and function. Relatively few non-invasive techniques are available for aquatic plants. Traditional methods such as sectioning are low-throughput and provide 2-dimensional information. X-ray Computed Microtomography (muCT) offers a non-destructive method of three dimensional (3D) imaging in planta, but has not been widely used for aquatic species, due to the difficulties in sample preparation and handling. We present a novel sample handling protocol for aquatic plant material developed for muCT imaging, using duckweed plants and turions as exemplars, and compare the method against existing approaches. This technique allows for previously unseen 3D volume analysis of gaseous filled spaces, cell material, and sub-cellular features. The described embedding method, utilizing petrolatum gel for sample mounting, was shown to preserve sample quality during scanning, and to display sufficiently different X-ray attenuation to the plant material to be easily differentiated by image analysis pipelines. We present this technique as an improved method for anatomical structural analysis that provides novel cellular and developmental information."
